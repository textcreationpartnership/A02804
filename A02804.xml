         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whether it be neceſsity in me, being in a low Fortune, (the common calamity of us Schollers) whether it be a perſwaſion of the good which may accrue to the Reader, or whether it be to feele the Pulſe of the Times, that knowing the temper of their acceptance, I may hereafter or expoſe or ſuppreſſe ſome other things, or what other ayme ſoever I have, doth not much concerne thee to know, and I ſhall make it a ſuit that I may ſtill keepe it private to my ſelfe.

               <hi>Xerxes</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> indeed, who carried that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army into <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> (conſiſting as ſome report, of a million of men) who drunk up whole rivers as they paſt, and made mountaines plaine before him; having at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time got the advantage of a Hill, and by that meanes taking a ſurvey of his great Hoſt, is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Hiſtorians to have ſighed and wept, to think that all thoſe multitudes of men which were then in his eye, ſhould within leſſe then an Age bee laid in the duſt, not ſo much as their very names remembred: Yet afterwards when this mighty Prince joyned battell with the ſmall Navy of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and was diſcomfited, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his men ſlaine, we doe not reade that the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſighed or grieved at all, but went on his ordinary courſe, undiſturbed and unmoved with the ſpectacle: nor doe wee heare that the <hi>Earth</hi> was at all troubled with the matter. Great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> dies, hee who conquered every thing, but his owne deſire of ſtill conquering more. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> dies, that learned and valiant <hi>Romane,</hi> that ſpirit of the world, whoſe <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Tongue,</hi> were alike <hi>victorious:</hi> and this man dies treacherouſly, betrayed in the Senate, amongſt his gowned friends.

               <hi>And it was about the ſixth houre</hi> (ſayes our Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt.) The firſt thing I doe ſhall bee to make St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Marke</hi> friends, who at the firſt ſight
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4113:7"/> may ſeeme to be at variance a little.<note place="margin">Marke 15.25.</note> For St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us in the 15. Chapter that it was at the third houre of the day.</p>
            <p>Wee are to underſtand therefore, that the <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall</hi> day amongſt the Jewes, began at ſixe a clock in the morning, and ended at ſixe in the Evening, ſo that the compaſſe of their <hi>artificiall</hi> day was twelue houres. (Are there not twelue houres in the day? ſayes our Saviour) So that calling our ſixth in the morning, the firſt houre of the day, the ſixth houre (according to their computation) muſt needs bee our Noone; and about or a little before this time was our Saviour crucified. But why doth St. <hi>Marke</hi> call it the third houre?</p>
            <p>I will not give ye <hi>Cajetanes</hi> anſwere, who ſaith, that there may bee an errour in the Scribe, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and writing the Greeke Character of one number for another, becauſe there is ſome affinity betwixt them in the figure. (<hi>exemp. gr.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> is ſomething better, who to excuſe the matter hath theſe words. <hi>Linguis Iudaeorum, crucifixus eſt horâ tertia, manibus horâ ſexta:</hi> The Jewes (ſaith hee) crucified with their <hi>tongues</hi> at the third houre (when they cryed out ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly; <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him, his blood be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us and upon our children</hi>) but they did not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him with their <hi>hands</hi> untill the <hi>ſixth.</hi> But if we obſerve St. <hi>Marks</hi> words well, wee ſhall finde that this interpretation cannot ſtand, for after he had ſaid, that hee was crucified at the <hi>third</hi> houre, hee preſently addes, and at the <hi>ſixth</hi> houre there was darkneſſe over the face of the earth; which laſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4113:8"/> words imply, that they crucified him not at the ſixth houre, but at another houre. Wherefore I doe rather ſubſcribe to the opinion of St. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Cyprian.</hi> As the Night (ſaith he) was divided into foure watches, ſo their Day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure parts, or houres.

For it is true that St. <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith they did crucifie really at or in the <hi>third houre;</hi> and it is alſo true which St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith here, and it was <hi>about</hi> the ſixth houre. <hi>About</hi> the ſixth houre, that is, a little before mid-day, our twelue of the clocke; and it was in the <hi>third</hi> houre too, (i.) in the latter part of the <hi>third</hi> houre, a little before Noone. And ſo although he was faſtned to the Croſſe a little before noone, yet hee did not give up the ghoſt untill the ninth houre, which is our three of the clocke after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that hee might directly anſwere to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, which by the Lords command was <hi>to bee killed at the Evening,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.6</note> Exod.</hi> 12 6. Or as the Originall reades it, <hi>betwixt the two Evenings.</hi> And here there may a queſtion bee raiſed, what part of the day ſhould be meant, by theſe words.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4113:8"/>
            <p>The opinions I finde are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt is <hi>Aben Ezras,</hi> and hee ſaith, That there is <hi>veſpera Solis,</hi> and <hi>veſpera luminis.</hi> An Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> when the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> is removed from our eyes, when <hi>that</hi> ſets: and an Evening of the <hi>light,</hi> when the <hi>beames</hi> or <hi>ſhining</hi> of the Sunne doe alſo forſake us. And betwixt theſe two Evenings (ſaith hee) was the Paſchall Lambe ſlaine; which time by us is called the twilight, which by the opinion of <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> doth ordinarily endure an houre and one third part.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond from <hi>Rabbi David,</hi> and he is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his interpretation, and underſtands a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter latitude of Time. There is (ſaith he) <hi>veſpera declinationis,</hi> and <hi>veſpera occaſus:</hi> An Evening of the Sunne <hi>declining,</hi> and an Evening of the Sunne <hi>ſetting.</hi> The Evening of the Sunne <hi>declining</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at twelue of the clock, when the Sunne is in his Altitude, in the Meridian, and ſo declines by degrees towards his fall. The Evening of the Sun <hi>ſetting</hi> what that is, wee all know: And betwixt theſe two Evenings, (i.) betwixt Noone and the Sunne ſetting, the Paſchall Lambe (ſaith he) was to be killed. And certainely this ſecond opinion is that which will endure the Touch-ſtone the beſt, for without queſtion by this phraſe, <hi>Betwixt the two Evenings,</hi> we are to underſtand ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of time, wherein the <hi>dayly</hi> Evening Sacrifice might bee ſlaine too as well as the Paſchall Lambe, for even that was commanded to bee done, <hi>inter duas veſperas,</hi> betwixt the two Evenings as well as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4113:9"/> the other,<note place="margin">Num. 28.4</note> 
               <hi>Num</hi> 28.4. And as the <hi>Talmud</hi> reports (if wee reckon the houres according to our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary computation) the dayly Sacrifice of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lambe was uſually ſlaine betwixt two and three, and betwixt three and foure it was offered: but upon the Paſſeover Eve it was ſlaine betwixt one and two, and offered betwixt two and three; and the reaſon was, becauſe they might have time afterwards for the ſlaying and offering of the Paſſeover: But if their Paſſeover Eve fell upon the Eve before their Sabbath, then their dayly Evening Sacrifice was ſlaine and offered an houre ſooner then ordinary, that there might bee time enough both for the Paſſeover, and alſo for the preparation of their Sabbath after that. And Chriſt that hee might ſhew us that his death did comprehend all Sacrifices (which indeed were nothing elſe but ſhadowes and types of that one and perfect Sacrifice, which hee at this time made upon the Croſſe, for the ſins of the whole world) he began to be crucified in the third houre of the day, with the dayly Morning Sacrifice, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it at the ninth houre with the dayly Evening Sacrifice and the Paſchall Lambe. Hee was both the Sacrifice of the <hi>Morning,</hi> and of the <hi>Evening:</hi> Hee was ſacrificed as well for thoſe who lived in the <hi>Morning</hi> of the world, before the Incarnation, as for all us who have lived ſince in the <hi>Evening,</hi> in its declining Age. Hee was the Sacrifice of the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> both for <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>old.</hi> Of the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening;</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and for the <hi>Weſt,</hi> for the whole world. The <hi>Morning</hi> and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4113:9"/> 
               <hi>Evening</hi> Sacrifice hee was, and therefore obſerve how the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> here doe meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as if it had beene on purpoſe) to mourne for him: and perceiving (it ſeemes) that their owne <hi>Apparell</hi> was a great deale too <hi>light</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to appeare in ſo ſad a buſineſſe, they borrow <hi>mourning garments</hi> out of the wardrobe of the Night, to wait upon the Hearſe. For at that very point of Time, wherein the Morning &amp; the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning meet together (which is Noone) did the darkneſſe begin, which continued for three houres following: The Noone, the height and glory of the day, weares blacke at his Funerall.</p>

Unto whom the voyce replyed (farre lowder then before) charging him, that as ſoone as hee came againſt the <hi>Palodes,</hi> hee ſhould publiſh to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, <hi>that the great Pan was dead.</hi> The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Ship being amazed at the ſtrangeneſſe

Which hee did, for finding it a very quiet Sea when they came thither, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Sterne of the Ship (againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodes</hi>) with his face towards land, hee cryed with a loude voyce, <hi>The great Pan is dead.</hi> Which meſſage was no ſooner deliver'd, but all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Shippe heard upon the ſuddaine a ſtrange and confuſed noyſe, ſounding like the out-cryes and lamentations of a diſtreſſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And this Ship afterwards arriving in <hi>Italy,</hi> the report of this ſtrange matter was ſoone heard of at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that e're long it came to the eare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, who ſending for the Maſter of the Ship, was certified of the Truth of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and calling his wiſe men together, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them who that great god <hi>Pan</hi> ſhould be, was anſwered by them, that hee was the ſonne of god <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Penelope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yee ſee what an account <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives of the death of great <hi>Pan.</hi> But if wee weigh the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſtory well, wee ſhall finde that this voyce did ſignifie the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> which caus'd the <hi>Oracles</hi> to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> and deſtroy'd the power of the devill. And it is not unlike but thoſe cryes which were heard in the <hi>Palodes,</hi> were the lamentations
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4113:13"/> of evill ſpirits, bewayling the downfall and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Kingdome. For firſt, this is reported to be done in <hi>Tiberius</hi> time, in whoſe raigne <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified, and why might it not be at the very time of his death, or immediatly after? beſides this, certaine it was that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had enquir'd and heard of Chriſt, and of many of his miracles, for if the Senate would have agreed to it, he would have <hi>canoniz'd</hi> him, and put him into the roll of their gods. And it is very credible, that by reaſon of our Saviours calling himſelfe by the name of the good and the great <hi>Shepheard,</hi> the Heathens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, might conclude, that it muſt needes be the god <hi>Pan,</hi> who was ſaid to be the god of the <hi>Shepheards.</hi> And the great god <hi>Pan</hi> it was indeed who was dead (taken in Chriſtian ſenſe) the great <hi>Shepheard</hi> of our <hi>ſoules, who left thoſe</hi> 99 <hi>above who had not err'd, and came downe to ſeeke and to ſave that</hi> One <hi>which had ſtray'd, poore mankinde.</hi> And from hence the ſilence of the <hi>Oracles,</hi> and the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of evill ſpirits. But the ſtrangeneſſe of this Hiſtory related by a Heathen Writer, hath carried me a little too farre. To returne to the Text, the opinion of the beſt Writers is, that this darkneſſe was not <hi>onely</hi> over the land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but <hi>generall,</hi> overall the earth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing we are to enquire of, is of the extent of this darkneſſe in reſpect of <hi>time:</hi> and that was from the ſixth to the ninth houre, from our 12. to 3.</p>
            <p>It began at <hi>Noone,</hi> at that point which is the moſt oppoſite to darkneſſe, and laſted till our three of

            <p>The darkneſſe began at <hi>Noone,</hi> (as wee may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) a little after Chriſt was nayl'd upon the Croſſe; ſo that if the <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſhould not yet be ſatisfied concerning her earneſt requeſt, when ſhee cryed out in the firſt Chapter of that Song, <hi>Shew mee (O thou whom my ſoule loveth,</hi>

Hee <hi>lay</hi> at Noone, the <hi>Croſſe</hi> was his <hi>bed</hi> of <hi>ſorrow</hi> he <hi>lay</hi> upon, the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> was the <hi>Curtaines</hi> drawne about him. As <hi>David</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Pſal 18.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. (though in an other ſenſe) <hi>Hee made dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his ſecret place,</hi> and his Pavilion round about him.</p>

            <p>Chriſt was borne in the <hi>night,</hi> as we underſtand by the Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. And there were Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards watching their Flocks by <hi>night.</hi> Yet when the Angell delivers the tydings of his birth to the Shepheards, hee doth not ſay this <hi>night,</hi> but, this <hi>day</hi> is borne to you a Saviour. It was <hi>naturally</hi> a <hi>night,</hi> but the birth of Chriſt <hi>miraculouſly</hi> made it a <hi>day: (and the glory of the Lord ſhone about them,</hi> ſayes the Text.) Chriſt dyes wee ſee here in the <hi>day,</hi> in the <hi>mid day,</hi> but even that is turn'd into a <hi>Night:</hi> It was a <hi>day naturally,</hi> but the death of our Saviour made it a <hi>night miraculouſly.</hi> And the reaſon for it is good; for it was not altogether ſo fitting, that the earth ſhould have worne one and the ſame Garment, both at the Birth and Funerall of her Lord. He was <hi>borne</hi> in the <hi>night,</hi> and that becomes <hi>day,</hi> hee <hi>dyed</hi> in the <hi>day,</hi> and that becomes <hi>night:</hi> See how Chriſt both in his <hi>Nativity</hi> and <hi>Paſsion,</hi> manifeſts himſelfe to be the God of <hi>Nature,</hi> who to ſhew her allegiance to her Lord and Maſter, quite inverts her ordinary courſe, and doth not wayte upon him in that livery which pleaſes her beſt; but in that which he commands, and is the moſt agreeable to his fortunes. So that as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples cryed out in an admiration, when he quieted the Stormes and Tempeſts, <hi>Who is this whom the winde and the Sea obeyeth?</hi> So may wee ſay here, Who is this whom the <hi>Night</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth?</p>
            <p>It began at the ſixth, and laſted till the ninth: ſo that the whole compaſſe or time of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was <hi>three</hi> of our ordinary houres. I might
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4113:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> here obſerve a myſterie in the number of 3, being the firſt perfect number, that number which (as Geometricians ſay) doth make the firſt figure, the number which <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls <hi>Numerus omnis rei,</hi> the number of every thing, and certainly hee had that hinte from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de Caelo. Omne totum</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in tribus ponimus.</hi> To every whole &amp; perfect thing is requir'd the number of 3. And why may not wee ſay, that as there went three dayes over his death, like three witneſſes to beare record of the truth of his death; ſo there went <hi>three houres</hi> of darkneſſe over his <hi>Paſsion;</hi> to beare witneſſe of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Paſsion.</hi> The compleat number of 3 went over his ſufferings, to manifeſt to the world that now his ſufferings were whole, perfect, and compleat; and therefore no ſooner are the three houres of darkneſſe over, but preſently he cryes <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> it is finiſhed, &amp; gave up the ghoſt. But we have beene too long in ſearching out the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this darkneſſe, which was the third thing I propounded to be enquir'd for. The neereſt cauſe (I told yee) was the darkning of the Sunne. But alas, this will not ſatisfie us. For as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in the 114. Pſalme (which is appointed by the Church to be read upon Eaſter day) doth not content himſelfe with ſaying, <hi>The Sea ſaw it and fled, Iordan was driven back:</hi> But hee addes alſo the queſtion, and ſayes, What ayleſt thou O Sea that thou fieddeſt? and thou Jordan that thou was driven back? So neither muſt wee thinke it enough to ſay the Sunne was darkned, and goe no further; but wee muſt <hi>Cauſam cauſae
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4113:15"/> inveſtigare,</hi> Finde out the ſupreame cauſe of that ſubordinate cauſe, and ſay, What ayleſt thou (O Sunne) that thou waſt darkened, and thou, Light, that thou waſt driven back? The Sunne was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned we confeſſe, but what was it that darkned the Sunne? This certainly will trouble us.</p>
            <p>There are but three things (ſuppoſing that wee are <hi>Sub dio et in ſterili proſpectu,</hi> Under the open Heaven, and withall have our eyes perfect) which can any wayes take from us the ſight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The interpoſition of <hi>Vapours or Clouds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The interpoſition of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The interpoſition of the <hi>Moone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Clouds, it is not likely that they ſhould cauſe this darkneſſe; For Saint <hi>Luke</hi> (here) after hee hath made mention of the darkneſſe which was in the ayre (the place of Clouds and Vapours) hee preſently addes, <hi>and</hi> the <hi>Sunne</hi> was darkned, making this the reaſon of the other darkneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo that wee may very ſafely beleeve, that the Sunne was not darkned <hi>onely to us,</hi> but even <hi>in it ſelfe too.</hi> Hee who ſayes unto the proud billowes of the Sea, <hi>Be yee ſtill,</hi> and <hi>thus farre yee ſhall goe and no farther;</hi> Hee is alſo able to ſay unto the <hi>Sunne, Thou ſhalt not ſhine.</hi> Hee who at the beginning was able to ſay, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> ſayes now, <hi>Let there be darkneſſe, and it was ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could not be the interpoſition of the Earth, for whenſoever that is interpoſed, it makes it night, (being nothing elſe but the ſhadowe of the Earth, which is betwixt our eyes and the Sunne) but this was at noone-day, when the Sunne was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4113:15"/> in his height, over the heads of the people of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
            <p>Nor yet was it poſſible it ſhould bee the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Moone, for the Sunne never ſuffers an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> by the darke body of the <hi>Moone,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Sunne and Moone are in a <hi>conjunction:</hi> but now they were in <hi>oppoſition,</hi> the Moone was at the full, or but newly paſt it, 180. degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Sunne. Which is eaſily proved, for the <hi>Paſchall Lambe</hi> was not (by Gods command) to be ſlaine <hi>niſi Luna quatuordecima,</hi> but upon the foureteenth day of the Moone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. and juſt the night before hee was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified did Chriſt eate the Paſſeover with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſo that this muſt needs be the fifteenth day of the Moone wherein he ſuffered; <hi>quando ſolenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai erat Azimorum,</hi> the firſt day of unleavened bread, which was the great and chiefe day of the Paſſeover, howſoever the Evangeliſt St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.17. may ſeeme to make the foureteenth day the firſt day of unleavened bread:<note place="margin">Mat. 26.17</note> 
               <hi>Now the firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread the Diſciples came to Ieſus, ſaying unto him, Where wilt thou that wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for thee to eate the Paſſeover?</hi> which muſt bee underſtood according to their <hi>Civill Account,</hi> their naturall day (according to that computation) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Sun-riſing, and ending with the riſing of the next Sunne, and in this regard the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day might be called the firſt of unleavened bread, becauſe it <hi>comprehended</hi> in it <hi>part</hi> of the firſt day of unleavened bread, which day (in their <hi>religious account</hi>) began at the Sunne-ſetting,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4113:16"/> and ended at the ſetting of the next.</p>
            <p>Wee have not yet found out the Cauſe of this darkneſſe. What ſhould the <hi>Night</hi> make here, uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the dominion of the <hi>Day?</hi> It is not ſuch a hard queſtion to anſwere. I will give it ye in three words. Chriſt, the ſcond Perſon in the ſacred Trinity, united to our humane nature, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father, by whom the worlds were made; the Lambe without ſpot, who was free from all ſinne, <hi>He hangs</hi> upon the <hi>Tree</hi> in <hi>torments,</hi> to ſatisfie for the ſinnes of the world, a ſpectacle to men and Angels; All his friends and kinsfolkes ſtand <hi>a farre off,</hi> and they who paſſe by, in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wagge their heads at him. And can we ſuppoſe that the <hi>Sunne</hi> can looke upon ſuch a ſight as this, and not plucke backe his head againe, as confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſpectacle? Or is it poſſible that <hi>the Light,</hi> which was Gods <hi>firſt Creature, his eldeſt ſonne in the Creation,</hi> ſhould endure that pitifull object and not flye? Alas! it ſtood and gazed upon him in that miſery as long as it could, but being able no longer to looke upon his tortured Lord, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his <hi>Empire</hi> to the Night, and fled into the lower world. Or elſe, as at his <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> (whoſe proper place was then the lower Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheare, for he was borne in the night) did come round from below to view him as hee lay in the Cradle, ſo doth the <hi>Night</hi> now ſteale about from the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to have a ſight of him, as hee hangs upon the Croſſe: Peradventure the ſonnes of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> (wicked Spirits and men, who were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to procure his death) had by this time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4113:16"/> with great triumph proclaimed the newes of his crucify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng in the gloomy Court of their mother <hi>Night,</hi> and ſhe not eaſily crediting that which ſhe much deſired, lifts up her drowſie head to ſee if the report were true: and true ſhee findes it; and therefore as delighted and pleaſed with the ſight, ſhe forgets her ſelfe it ſeemes, and ſtands full three houres together to looke upon him. Or elſe is the <hi>Night</hi> imployed here upon an Ambaſſage by the <hi>Moone,</hi> (who is ordinarily called the Queene of the Night) and by her <hi>traine of Attendants,</hi> the Stars, to ſee what the matter was above, that the <hi>Sunne</hi> denied them that tribute of <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>light</hi> which he was accuſtomed to pay them? For wee muſt needs ſuppoſe that the <hi>Sunne</hi> was not the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufferer</hi> here; but alſo the Moone and the Stars below (where it was naturally a night) did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the darkneſſe too. As when ſome great Peere falls by Treaſon, his whole blood, all his children and kindred are tainted, and his whole family uſually ſuffers in his fall. For the <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> borrowing their light from the <hi>Sunne,</hi> when the <hi>Sunne</hi> is darkned muſt need, bee darke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too: ſo that at this time there was a <hi>ſecond night</hi> invaded even the <hi>night it ſelfe.</hi> And this is an other Argument to prove the Univerſality of the darkneſſe. It was darke in <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> Horizon (which is called, <hi>umbilicus terrae,</hi> the Navell or the middle of the Earth) becauſe the <hi>Sun to them,</hi> to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> was darkned; and it was darke, <hi>a tergo terrae,</hi> in the other halfe, in the backe parts of the Earth, becauſe the <hi>Sunne</hi> was darkened not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4113:17"/> 
               <hi>onely</hi> to the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> (for had hee remained in his glory at this time, he would have given prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at the firſt hand, no light to them, becauſe the Earth was interpoſed betwixt their ſight and it) but alſo to the Moone and Starres, all whoſe light which they ſeeme many times to bee ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of, as if it were their owne peculiar, is nothing elſe but the reflection of his beames.</p>
            <p>And there may bee three reaſons given of this darkning of the Sunne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it might upbraid the hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Jewes and Souldiers who crucified him, ſeeing that nature even in her inſenſible, parts did ſuffer with Chriſt; and beget a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fellow-feeling of his miſeries even in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts, as we ſee it did in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a man acquainted with cruelties, blood, and maſſacres, a generation of people which are not eaſily moved to pity by funeralls or ſlaughters: and yet this man in the next verſe but one follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Text ſeeing what was done, is forced to give glory to God, and ſay, <hi>of a ſurety this man was juſt.</hi> And if it wrought ſo upon this <hi>Captaine,</hi> this <hi>Romane ſpirit,</hi> O how did it worke upon the tender heart of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> the mother of our Saviour? upon <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved Diſciple of the Lord? and upon all thoſe women who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him from <hi>Galilee,</hi> and ſtood afarre off, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him as well as the obſcurity would give them leave? It wrought ſo bitterly with them, that it is the note of an Expoſitor; That not one of them who were preſent (I meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionatly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4113:17"/> preſent) at this ſight, did after ſuffer Martyrdome. <hi>Adeo enim vehemens</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>fait ille crucis gladius, adeoque ptarum animarum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neritudnem tranſverberavit, ut fuerit illis pro Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrio computatum:</hi> So vehement ſharpe and bitter was that fight unto their wounded eyes, and (like a ſword dividing the marrow and the bone) did ſo pierce through their ſoftned hearts, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed them from any after-Martyrdome, the Lord thought that enough for them. They were even <hi>Martyrs,</hi> in <hi>beholding</hi> the Martyrdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the taking away of this <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> light might bee a ſigne of the ſubtraction of the <hi>true</hi> light out of the hearts of the <hi>Iewiſh Nation,</hi> which was the <hi>effect</hi> of that unanimous voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; <hi>His blood be upon us and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> For we ſee that there hath beene a <hi>darkneſſe</hi> ever ſince over the <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>underſtandings</hi> of that people, even unto this houre, denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the naked body of Chriſt, (dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that accurſed manner, expoſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorne of all who paſſe by) might not bee looked upon <hi>with joy</hi> by his wicked <hi>Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>blaſphemours,</hi> therefore is this darkeneſſe ſent to ſtrike a <hi>terrour</hi> into their ſoules, even when they ſuppoſed to make themſelves <hi>merry</hi> with the <hi>ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have ſeene how <hi>Nature</hi> was affected at his death, for, for the ſtate of his Funerall, ſhee hung <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> with <hi>blacks:</hi> Wee are now to ſee how the <hi>God</hi> of Nature takes the matter,

               <hi>Wherefore it ſhall be ſpoken in the booke of the Battels of the Lord, what thing hee did in the red Sea, and in the rivers of Arnon, and at the ſtreame of the river which goeth downe unto the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Ar, and lyeth upon the border of Moab.</hi> Wee ſee that the Text joynes the <hi>miracle</hi> of the <hi>red Sea,</hi> and the buſineſſe of the <hi>rivers</hi> of <hi>Arnon</hi> together, and therefore (ſay they) there muſt needes be a miracle <hi>here,</hi> as well as at the <hi>red Sea.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We anſwere, that there is a great and excellent reaſon for this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>mountaines</hi> and the <hi>rammes, contemplative</hi> men, and Angels of the firſt <hi>Hierarchy</hi> are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, to ſhew that there is a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>leapes</hi> of the ſpirit of man, and the <hi>leapes</hi> of thoſe ſublime and intellectuall Eſſenſes: but for feare leſt any man ſhould thinke that this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4113:25"/> might bee <hi>comparatio ad gradum,</hi> a compariſon of <hi>equality,</hi> and from hence bee bold to affirme, that the firſt order of men <hi>(contemplatives)</hi> doth <hi>ex pari reſpondere primo gradui Angelorum,</hi> directly equall the firſt Hierarchy of Angells, the ſecond order of men (which is the ſpeculatives) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Hierarchy, and the third order of men (which are the men of Action and ſecular imployment) the third Hierarchy: therefore the Pen of <hi>David</hi> here (which was certainely guided by the holy Spirit) doth rather chooſe to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But before we can learne truely after what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>mountaines</hi> and the <hi>hills</hi> doe leape, we muſt firſt looke upon the patterne after which they doe leape.</p>
            <p>By thoſe forenamed living creatures (I told yee) wee might in a myſticall ſenſe underſtand the three Hierarchies of Angels. The firſt three orders, <hi>Seraphim, Cherubin, Throni,</hi> (which are likened unto the mountaines) are they which are immediately joyned to God, who doe inlighten all the inferiour orders, but doe receive no illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from any ſave from God. The three <hi>ſecond</hi> orders (which here lie in method in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4113:25"/> although not obſerved by the Pſalmiſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hills) are <hi>Dominations, Vertues,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,</hi> and theſe doe both receive illumination from the <hi>higher</hi> orders, and give to the inferiour. The three laſt orders are <hi>Powers, Arch-angels,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and theſe <hi>receive</hi> light or knowledge from the ſuperiour Hierarchies, but have no orders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to whom to communicate any illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now for every one of theſe orders to <hi>leape</hi> in his kinde, is <hi>ſupra ſemetipſos ire,</hi> to riſe up in a Contemplation unto ſuch things as are above their owne nature. For the firſt orders therefore to reade the <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> the <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> of God in any of the inferiour orders, or <hi>in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta creatura,</hi> in the Fabrick of the world, <hi>hoe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendere potius quam ſaltus dare,</hi> this is rather to <hi>goe downe</hi> then to <hi>leape:</hi> To view the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>majeſtie</hi> of God in themſelves, in looking into their owne pure nature, <hi>hoc illorum eſt per planum ire,</hi> this is their <hi>plaine</hi> way, they neither <hi>riſe</hi> nor <hi>fall</hi> in doing <hi>thus.</hi> But they are ſaid to <hi>leape</hi> when they aſcend into a ſimple and naked <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Power, the Wiſedome, the Majeſty of God <hi>as he is in himſelfe,</hi> and ſo behold with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that <hi>Fountaine</hi> of <hi>beauty,</hi> of <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> of <hi>order,</hi> of <hi>proportion.</hi> The ſecond and third Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies they are onely ſaid to <hi>leape</hi> when they doe riſe in a <hi>ſpeculation</hi> into the orders above them, and from thence are furniſhed with matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration concerning the Divine power, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For although it be granted, that theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour orders have alſo their <hi>ſimple contemplations,</hi>

            <p>But I muſt make bold in the midſt of theſe foure, to inſert one face more of Chriſts, which <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> did not thinke of, and that is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facies reſurgentis:</hi> The face of Chriſt <hi>ariſing from the dead,</hi> ſubduing the <hi>grave,</hi> and leading Captivity captive. And this is the face of Chriſt meant here, at the ſight of which the Earth was <hi>moved. The Mountaines skipped, &amp;c.</hi> And what thing is there ſo heavy, that could ſit ſtill and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this face? O let not us then be more inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible then the Mountaines and Hills to which wee are compared: for we muſt know that the ſtrength of the compariſon doth not lie in the ponderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Mountaines: No, wee ought not to imitate them in this: but it doth conſiſt in the height, in their neerneſſe to heaven, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the common roades of men. Lift up your heads therefore, O yee gates, and be yee lift
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4113:27"/> up yee everlaſting doores, and the King of glory will come in.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, O yee <hi>mountaines</hi> of the earth, who doe enjoy a vicinity and kinde of familiarity with God and heaven; Yee men of <hi>contemplation,</hi> who by the advantage of your height, have a far clearer and neerer proſpect of God, and of the wonders that are in him, then they who are upon the little Hills and Plaines of the earth below; O lift up your heads on high in a thankfull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admiration of the wiſedome, the power, the mercy of our God, who ſent his onely Sonne in whom he was well pleaſed into the world, that he by his poverty, his ignominie, his obedience, his death, might make an atonement for our ſins. And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>day</hi> wherein that gracious worke was perfectly finiſhed; this is the day wherein our Saviour Chriſt having entred into the houſe of that ſtrong man, <hi>Death,</hi> and bound him, like a Giant refreſhed with wine, iſſued out of the Grave in triumph. Or once, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us reioyce and be glad in it.</hi> For be ſure that the Lord lookes for greater, higher, and more frequent leapes <hi>from you,</hi> for purer and more exalted notions approaching neere unto the contemplation of Angells, then he doth from the <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Plaines:</hi> For to whom much is given, of him ſhall much be required. So that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>himſelfe</hi> concerning preaching of the Goſpell, <hi>Woe is me if I preach not the Goſpell:</hi> ſo may I ſay of <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and of all our whole Tribe the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> with me, of all the Prieſts of the Lord, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4113:28"/> Sonnes of the Prophets, who are as it were a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet apart for God himſelfe, and like the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines neerer heaven, are, or at the leaſt ſhould be farther removed from the plaines of the earth, worldly cares &amp; imployments, to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from theſe outward deſtractions and diſturbances, wee ſhould the more intend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the good of his people. <hi>Woe he unto us</hi> if wee above other men doe not leape for joy, doe not ſing ſongs of deliverance unto the God of our redemption.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>O yee Hills praiſe yee the Lord.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Davids</hi> counſell, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 148. <hi>Yee ſpeculative</hi> men, who are not yet growne up to the altitude of <hi>mountaines,</hi> yee who are not able yet to climbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>a ſimple contemplation</hi> of God: but doe behold his wiſedome and power in the <hi>Glaſſe</hi> of the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in the Creation &amp; Government of the world: O doe yee leape too; and although yee cannot yet fetch ſuch <hi>Maſculine</hi> leapes as the Rammes do, let not this diſcourage yee. Here is a degree of compariſon for you too, doe it like the <hi>Lambes,</hi> or the <hi>young ones</hi> of the Flock. Nor muſt we exempt the Fields, the Plaines of the Earth from bearing a part in this joy, the men of action and ſecular buſineſſe, they muſt come in for their ſhare too: and although they cannot <hi>leape</hi> or <hi>skip</hi> like the <hi>mountaines</hi> or the <hi>hills,</hi> yet we will finde out an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for them too. Whilſt the <hi>mountaines</hi> and the <hi>hills dance</hi> before the preſence of the Lord, and trace it in comely figures together, the <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vallyes</hi> ſhall <hi>ſing</hi> unto them as they paſſe, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4113:28"/> this I am ſure they are able to doe: For <hi>David</hi> in one of his Pſalmes brings them in in the very ſame action, and makes the moving cauſe of it to bee onely the fruitfulneſſe of the Earth. The vallyes (ſaith he) ſtand ſo thick with corne, that they doe <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>ſing.</hi> But wee have a greater cauſe then the fruitfulneſſe of the <hi>Earth</hi> to move us: the <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of heaven</hi> is fallen upon <hi>us,</hi> and the Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us. Hee whom the other day wee left hanging upon the Croſſe, the ſcorne and laughter of Paſſengers, and hath lyen as impriſoned in the houſe of death for three dayes and three nights, hath now broken from the priſon of the Grave, and to our endleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and eternall Salvation, looſed and ſhaken off the bands of death, not onely for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> over whom death ſhall have no more dominion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for <hi>us</hi> too: For now ſince his conqueſt, <hi>Death</hi> hath loſt his ſtrength, nor ſhall the <hi>Grave</hi> be able now to hold any of <hi>us</hi> hereafter. The force of the Priſon wall is decayed, and through the breach which his bleſſed <hi>Reſurrection</hi> hath made therein, ſhall we finde a way unto eternity of <hi>living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore who are the Vallyes &amp; Plaines of the Earth, though we are not able to leape and ſkip after the manner of the mountaines and hills, who have higher and purer revelations then our ſelves, although wee cannot ſing unto the honour of our Saviour in ſo heavenly a ſtraine, or in ſo wel penn'd Anthemes as they; yet let us not faile to doe our endeavours, though it bee in a more homely Muſick, for the Lord doth not deſpiſe the

            <p>Let us therefore for this preſent joyne our ſelves in <hi>Chorus</hi> with old <hi>Zachary,</hi> Luke 1. and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for hee hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Amen.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4113:30"/>
'tis the comelieſt thing about him, and he doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> the moſt honour who pictures him <hi>weeping.</hi> Alas! to call to minde onely the ſinnes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of this holy man, onely to mention how ſhamefully he denied his Maſter, and to leave out his bitter weeping, and his repentance (which is the beſt part of the ſtory) were to bring him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage onely to diſgrace him; but that man doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> right, who remembers his <hi>repentance</hi> as well as his <hi>ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have in this Scripture then theſe three things.</p>

            <p>Secondly, The <hi>cauſe</hi> of his ſorrow. And that is (we ſee) our Saviours <hi>ſaying unto him the third time, loveſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>effect</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſorrow. And this is double; Neerer, or, farther off.</p>
            <p>The effect which I call the neerer, is St. <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The effect of his ſorrow which I call the farther off, is the reply of Chriſt unto <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer. <hi>Ieſus ſaid unto him, Feede my Sheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſory.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Peter</hi> might this be? That <hi>Peter</hi> who in the Goſpell read for this day, by reaſon of that cleare Confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the living God,</hi> was pronounced <hi>bleſſed</hi> by the mouth of Chriſt? That <hi>Peter</hi> to whom were given the Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, ſo that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he bindes on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4113:30"/> and whatſoever he looſes on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven?

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>bleſſed</hi> is ſorrowfull. Certainly then it is not altogether ſuch an accurſed and hatefull thing, to endure affliction and troubles here upon earth, as it is ſuppoſed it is. Be comforted then thou who art in miſery, art perſecuted or afflicted, for thou ſeeſt that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here, who was in the opinion of no leſſe then Chriſt, <hi>a bleſſed man,</hi> hee was in <hi>ſorrow,</hi> hee was griev'd: which did not a whit diminiſh his bleſſedneſſe, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter the holy</hi> is <hi>ſorrowfull.</hi> O then it is in vaine to looke for true felicity here on earth. The greateſt Saints of God (we ſee) are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their rainie dayes and tempeſts: a perpetuall calme is onely to be found in heaven. Nay <hi>Peter</hi> who to his <hi>inward</hi> gifts and <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> had alſo an outward competency of <hi>corporall</hi> goods; he was full, he wanted nothing, hee was newly riſen from a Feaſt, he enjoy'd the company of his <hi>friends,</hi> and his <hi>companions</hi> were round about him (no ſmall bleſſing.) Nay, hee had the bodily preſence of <hi>Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> Nor was hee furniſhed onely for the preſent, but hee had alſo proviſion for many dayes, no leſſe then a Stock of an hundred fifty and three great fiſhes for hereafter; ſo that hee might have ſaid with the rich Foole in the Goſpell, <hi>Soule take thy reſt, thou haſt goods enough layd up for thee.</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:4113:31"/> No, all this cannot ſhut griefe out of the heart of Saint <hi>Peter. Peter</hi> for all <hi>this</hi> was <hi>ſorie.</hi> Let us learne therefore from hence to know that true joy (which is without any mixture of griefe) is not to be found in any earthly good whatſoever: not in thy <hi>riches,</hi> not in thy <hi>dainties,</hi> not in thine <hi>honors,</hi> not in the <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of thy <hi>friends.</hi> No; Seeke for that in any other place, except it be in heaven, and bee ſure that thou ſhalt loſe thy labour.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But <hi>why</hi> is <hi>Peter</hi> ſory? becauſe his Maſter aſks him whether <hi>he loves</hi> him or no? What could there be in <hi>this</hi> which could <hi>grieve</hi> Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> One would have thought that this ſhould rather have made him <hi>joyfull,</hi> to heare <hi>his Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>whole world,</hi> to <hi>talke</hi> ſo <hi>familiarly</hi> with him? to take ſuch <hi>particular</hi> notice of <hi>him,</hi> and of his <hi>love?</hi> No, this is not all. For wee finde our Saviour ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very <hi>ſame words</hi> unto him <hi>twice</hi> before, and yet he was not a whit mov'd at it then: but now he ſayes unto him the <hi>third time: loveſt thou mee?</hi> As if ſome ſecret <hi>influence</hi> had beene wrapt up in thoſe words, and ſo convay'd into his ſoule, yee may diſcerne a <hi>ſuddaine alteration</hi> in the man. What ſhould the meaning of this be? Shall wee ſay that there is any <hi>Magick</hi> or <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the number of <hi>three?</hi> Wee muſt not ſay it. But this wee may ſay. A hidden <hi>vertue,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> there was in thoſe <hi>words</hi> of our Saviour repeated <hi>thrice</hi> unto him. Alas! at the firſt and ſecond ſpeaking of them, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did not know the meaning of our Saviour: but no ſooner doth he come upon him with that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4113:31"/> the <hi>third time,</hi> but then hee begins to recollect himſelfe, and verily beleeve that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it more then ordinary. As if <hi>Peter</hi> had dialogued thus with himſelfe. What ſhould this meane that my Lord and Maſter doth ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat theſe words to mee? <hi>Loveſt thou mee? loveſt thou mee? loveſt thou mee?</hi> Would not this <hi>once</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med have ſerved the turne? Is it poſſible that Chriſt can affect empty repetitions, which are like clouds without water? Certainly, all his words are ponderous; nor doth a ſyllable fall from his bleſſed lips, but what is full of meaning and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. No leſſe then <hi>thrice together,</hi> loveſt thou me?</p>
            <p>O my tormented conſcience! I have it. <hi>One deepe calls upon another, becauſe of the noyſe of the water pipes.</hi> Now our Apoſtle begins to dive a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into the myſtery of the <hi>number</hi> 3. and thinks with himſelfe what he can call to mind within the compaſſe or intimation of that number which <hi>may concerne himſelfe.</hi> And ſure he ſhall not need to be long in meditation about it. If hee chance to bee forgetfull, wee'l bring the <hi>Cocke</hi> againe to waken his memory, and that ſhall crow but <hi>once,</hi> to tell him that hee hath denied his Maſter <hi>thrice.</hi> O, it was this which touched him to the quicke; his mind preſently upon Chriſts <hi>third</hi> repetition, ran backe to his <hi>threefold</hi> deniall. Now <hi>Peter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the intent of his Maſter; but yet (ſure) not all his intent, for then hee would never have grieved for the matter. He fixes onely upon that part of it which did reſpect the hainouſneſſe of his former ſinne, and called that backe to his memory:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4113:32"/> it is likely he never thought at that time upon the other part of Chriſts intention, which was the good and honour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that by this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold open confeſſion of his Lord and Saviour, hee might (as much as in him lay) expiate his three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold deniall of him. This was certainly the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſon why our Saviour urges this to <hi>Peter</hi> the third time, that hee might give him an occaſion to redeeme the honour, which hee had loſt before. Hee <hi>denied</hi> him <hi>thrice</hi> before, and now to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for that, he <hi>confeſſes</hi> him as <hi>often.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it runnes in the Text, <hi>And Peter was ſory becauſe hee ſaid unto him the third time, loveſt thou mee:</hi> which implies that <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſo much grieved for the ſinne of his deniall it ſelfe, as hee was at the unkindneſſe (as hee ſuppoſed) of our Saviour: who <hi>firſt</hi> ſeemes to make it a <hi>great doubt</hi> whether <hi>Peter</hi> loved him or no, in aſking him ſo often. And well hee might doubt of it, (although to ſpeake properly, Chriſt could not doubt of any thing, becauſe he knew all things) for <hi>Peter</hi> by his former denialls had given him ſufficient cauſe to doubt. And <hi>ſecondly</hi> by this threefold Queſtion ſeemes to upbraid <hi>Peter</hi> with the ſame buſineſſe that the Cock told him of before. And this is the nature of us all, who commonly doe thinke ſo well of our ſelves that we account it a great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have our <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> our <hi>love,</hi> or our <hi>religion</hi> called in queſtion. No; let us alone, wee are well, wee love God, and wee love Chriſt, wee hope for heaven, and wee know all ſhall bee well with us. To what purpoſe are all theſe queſtions?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4113:32"/> With <hi>Peter</hi> we are ſory if any one aſks us whether we love Chriſt or no? In the next place, wee are of the ſame nature with St. <hi>Peter</hi> too: by any meanes we doe not love to <hi>heare</hi> of our <hi>ſinnes.</hi> We doe not reade here, that CHRIST was any whit plaine or open with <hi>Peter.</hi> Hee did not tell him of his ſinne in a <hi>diameter,</hi> in a ſtraight line, for wee finde not a word of any <hi>denials</hi> mentioned: but onely <hi>tacitely</hi> and <hi>inſinuatingly,</hi> doth hee by his threefold confeſſion, bring backe to his memory his threefold deniall, which hee knew could not chuſe but do it. It is likely that the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who were preſent with them at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, tooke no notice at all of his meaning: it was <hi>onely</hi> knowne to <hi>Peter himſelfe,</hi> who had a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant monitor within him, his conſcience, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his apprehenſion, and yet for all this, <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>grieved.</hi> And it was well he was but <hi>grieved:</hi> hee was not <hi>angry</hi> as many of us will bee now adayes, when we heare our darling ſinnes a little touched. O yee will hug us of the Clergy, ſo long as wee let yee alone; ſo long as wee doe not bring backe your <hi>ſinnes</hi> to your <hi>memory,</hi> wee are quiet and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, ſo long as wee will ſuffer ye to goe to Hell in a Horſe litter, a fine eaſie pace, without any rubs or moleſtations in your way, we ſhall be accounted good and worthy men amongſt yee: but let us come once to ſhake off that baſeneſſe of ſpirit, and tell yee of the dangerous eſtate yee are in by reaſon of your ſinnes (as it was with <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> in the 5. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> at the ſight of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall) the faſhion of your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4113:33"/> preſently is changed, and your blood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly is up in armes, as if yee could finde in your hearts (were it in your power) to daſh that blood in the face of him who reproves yee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though afterwards your cold hearts cried out for want of it. But thus did not St. <hi>Peter;</hi> we doe not reade that hee was <hi>angry,</hi> becauſe Chriſt put him in minde of his paſt ſinnes, we finde him <hi>ſorrowfull</hi> indeed, <hi>Peter was ſory,</hi> but the <hi>effect</hi> of his ſorrow was excellent. That is a good ſorrow which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a <hi>confeſsion</hi> of Gods <hi>omniſcience,</hi> and ſuch was St. <hi>Peters.</hi> And ſo we are come to the</p>
            <p n="3">3 Third thing I obſerved in the Text. The <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> ſorrow. Which is either <hi>nearer,</hi> and is the anſwer of St. <hi>Peter: Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Or elſe <hi>farther off,</hi> and that is Chriſts <hi>reply: Ieſus ſaid unto him, Feed my ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, &amp;c.</hi> Doe men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>grapes</hi> of <hi>thornes,</hi> or <hi>figges</hi> of <hi>thiſtles?</hi> who would ever have looked for ſo faire a fruit from ſo bitter a tree? If <hi>this</hi> be the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> Lord give us enough of that ſorrow, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy Wiſedome, thy Omnipotence. But is it not every ſorrow that will doe this? No, there is a ſorrow unto <hi>vanity,</hi> and there is a ſorrow unto <hi>death;</hi> from which, Lord of thy mercy deliver us: But it is the ſorrow onely for our ſinnes, which is the tree upon which that goodly fruit doth grow.</p>
            <p>I make haſt to the laſt words, which is the thing I chiefly aime at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieſus ſaid unto him, Feed my ſheepe.</hi> If thou doſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4113:33"/> love mee as thou profeſſeſt thou doſt, expreſſe it then in feeding of my ſheepe.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are mightily tumbled and toſſed up and downe betwixt us and our adverſaries the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this Text makes very ſtrongly for the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy, who is (as they boaſt) St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, ſits in his Chaire, retaining ſtill the ſame authority and juriſdiction, which Chriſt then gave to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here be three branches in this Controverſie.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whether our Saviour by ſpeaking theſe words to St. <hi>Peter, Feed my ſheepe,</hi> did conferr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him any <hi>ſupreame</hi> or <hi>univerſall</hi> authority over the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and over the <hi>Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 If ſo, whether this Authority and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was onely <hi>perſonall,</hi> limited and confined to the <hi>perſon</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with whom it died; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſucceſsive,</hi> to all his Succeſſours?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or if both theſe, whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors? Or if this be granted, whether the Popes as they are now, may be called S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors? becauſe, although wee grant a <hi>perſonall</hi> ſucceſſion, yet wee deny a ſucceſſion of Doctrine. The old Doctrine that St. <hi>Peter</hi> eſtabliſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> is much impaired and corrupted.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the laſt.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt died not in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which is a thing they contend for ſtrongly, for otherwiſe they of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4113:34"/> 
               <hi>Antioch</hi> might alſo boaſt themſelves to be St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſucceſſors, for hee was Biſhop there ſeven yeeres) is a point mightily controverted and the Arguments which are brought for confirmation of the negative part (I doe acknowledge) doe make <hi>Bellarmine</hi> many times (as great a Scholler as he was) to awaken his beſt wits to anſwer them. But the narrow limits of a Sermon will not ſuffer me to name them, much leſſe to urge them, nor will we quarrell much for this: For I confeſſe that I am much lead by the Authority of St. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his <hi>Booke of the famous men,</hi> notwithſtanding all the arguments to the contrary of <hi>Velenus, Illyricus, Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Centuries</hi> of the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> drawen either from <hi>Chronology,</hi> and computation of yeares, and raignes of <hi>Emperours; Peter</hi> being as we finde in the fifth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> preſent at the <hi>Councel</hi> holden at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> amongſt the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church, concerning the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> which Councell was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the eighteenth yeare after Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: or whether they bee taken from the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which I muſt needs acknowledge can bee at the beſt but <hi>confecturall</hi> and <hi>negative,</hi> which are no good witneſſes (even in our Common-law) againſt a depoſed <hi>affirmative;</hi>) either from thoſe Epiſtles which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote <hi>from</hi> Rome, as to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> the <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor yet in that Epiſtle of his <hi>to the Romans</hi> (which hee wrote from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>) doth hee once remember St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or deſire at all to bee commended to <hi>him,</hi> as yee may ſee in the laſt to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Greet <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> greet <hi>Andronicus,</hi> greet <hi>Vrbanus,</hi> ſalute <hi>Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Patrobas,</hi> and <hi>Philologus,</hi> and a great number more: but not a word of ſaluting St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Now ſay they, it was not a likely thing, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould amongſt all theſe friends of his, ſo much neglect and ſleight St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as not to remember him at all, if he had beene at <hi>Rome.</hi> I doe confeſſe, this reaſon hath ſome ſhew of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in it, but according to my apprehenſion, theſe things are anſwered well enough by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> The words of St. <hi>Ierome</hi> are (Engliſhed) theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon Peter, the ſonne of Iohn, of the Province of Galilee, and village of Bethſaida, brother to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and chiefe of the Apoſtles, after his being Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop at Antioch, and his preaching to the diſperſed Iewes in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and B<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4113:35"/> Lord and Maſter did.</hi> Thus farre St. <hi>Ierome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truely, Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Centuries</hi> ſhall pardon me, for I have great reaſon for many reſpects to beleeve St. <hi>Ierome</hi> before them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the Papiſts got much by this grant, by yeelding that <hi>Peter</hi> lived and died at <hi>Rome,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can bring their Argument to any head, they have two hard Provinces to runne through, two difficult buſineſſes to prove. The firſt of which is (as I told yee when I branched the que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtion) that the authority of St. <hi>Peter</hi> above the other Apoſtles is <hi>hereditary,</hi> and derived to his Succeſſors; and next (which will bee the hardeſt of all) to prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>any ſuch Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> given him. So that although wee yeeld that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that all the <hi>Popes</hi> have beene, and are his lawfull <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> and grant farther that theſe lawfull ſucceſſours of St. <hi>Peter</hi> have the <hi>very ſame authority</hi> and ſupremacy derived upon them which their Predeceſſour had before given him by Chriſt. Yet for all this they have done nothing, for hee who is heire <hi>ex toto aſſe,</hi> of the whole inheritance of his father, can be <hi>but</hi> heire of his <hi>whole inheritance,</hi> hee can poſſeſſe no more then his father left him. Now we denie that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had any <hi>ſuch Supremacy given</hi> him, and they can inherit no more Supremacy then hee had to beſtow upon them.</p>
            <p>But they will prove it (they ſay) out of this Text. Our Saviour ſaith here to Saint <hi>Peter alone,</hi> and that in the <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>other</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles, Feede my Sheepe.</hi> He doth not ſay to <hi>Iohn, Feede my

But it ſeemes they are hardly put to it, that they are forced to runne to a blinde Heathen <hi>Poet,</hi> for an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts meaning.

               </gap>e his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in his Saints, that they did dedicate ſet dayes on purpoſe for his worſhip, as the day of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> of our Saviour, the day of his <hi>Paſsion,</hi> of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which was indeed the great day of the yeare, which did quite abrogate the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4113:38"/> the day alſo of the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> wherein the Comforter was ſent to the Diſciples. Nor did their devotion ſtop here, but becauſe they might let ſlip no occaſion to praiſe the Lord, they alſo did ſet apart certaine dayes wherein God ſhould be glorified in the anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie memory of his Saints. <hi>At ipſa ſanctitas, &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum ſimul memoria frigidis his noſtris temporibus exulant.</hi> But our times frozen with a certaine new upſtart diſcipline blowne from <hi>Geneva,</hi> are ſo farre from affording any honourable mention of Gods Saints, that many of us quarrell the very name. And indeed to ſay the truth, what have they to doe with the <hi>word,</hi> when the <hi>thing</hi> which the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies is <hi>baniſhed</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>I doe acknowledge, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſomething too ceremonious, too complementall in regard of the Saints, and doth beſtow too much honour upon them, many times even to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Gods glory. But ſhall we therefore (like fooles or mad men) in a wilde deſire of oppoſition erre farther on the other hand? becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them a little too much, therefore ſhall wee diſhonour them? God hath beene pleaſed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them in heaven, like the Starres in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>The juſt ſhall ſhine as the Sunne in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Father, ſaith our Saviour in the</hi> 13. <hi>of Saint Mathew ver.</hi> 43. And therefore certainely theſe are not fit objects of our ſcorne and neglect.</p>
            <p>But to give (if it be poſſible) ſome ſatisfaction to the froward and ignorant concerning theſe dayes dedicated to the Saints. If Antiquity would

For certaine it is, that this dedication of dayes unto the honour of the Saints, (or to the honour of God in the Saints, chooſe yee which) is of great <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> The Romaniſts have indeed abuſed this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and have multiplied the number of their Saints beyond the number of their dayes, it may bee have put in ſome into the number of their Saints, when there hath beene neither ſuch Saints nor ſuch men. But it is no good argument from the abuſe of a Thing to conclude againſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full uſe. But I will leave Antiquity, which they care not for, and will deale with them by reaſon.</p>
            <p>I was too blame to tell them ſo. I doubt my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will fare the worſe for comming to them in that livery. <hi>Carnall reaſoning</hi> (as they call it) they cannot abide. O that ſuch people would but heare without prejudice. For what is he who hath not loſt all that is man about him, when hee ſhall heare the reaſons which are alleadged for the dedication of theſe dayes, but muſt needes (mee thinkes) retract his lunacie and folly, and call the <hi>former Ages wiſe,</hi> and our <hi>ſelves happy; them</hi> for firſt <hi>inſtituting,</hi> and <hi>us</hi> for <hi>enjoying</hi> thoſe bleſſed occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and meanes to build us up in devotion?</p>
            <p>The dayes therefore dedicated to the memory of the bleſſed Virgin St. <hi>Mary,</hi> the holy Apoſtles, and Martyrs, have many profitable and religious uſes.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4113:39"/>
            <p>Firſt, That upon thoſe dayes wee might joyne <hi>our</hi> rejoycing with <hi>theirs,</hi> communicate together in our joy and praiſes of God. And for this it is that we beleeve and confeſſe in our Creed, <hi>A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that we might ſhew our thankfulneſſe both unto <hi>God</hi> and to <hi>them,</hi> who are ſo ſolicitous for our good, and doe ſo thirſt after, and rejoyce at our ſalvation and glory. <hi>There is joy in heaven for one ſinner that repents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That wee contemplating their <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> might be provoked to an imitation of their godly lives.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That our Faith and Hope might by the conſideration of them be eſtabliſhed, that, as we verely beleeve, that they are now glorified in Heaven, who were once mortall men here on Earth, ſubject to the ſame paſſions, to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities with our ſelves: ſo wee following their ſteps in vertuous and religious living ſhall one day alſo be removed from this earth, and enjoy with them an everlaſting viſion of glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That <hi>God</hi> thereby might be <hi>honoured.</hi> For if we <hi>ſo</hi> honour the <hi>memory</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this very action of ours muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>more glorious,</hi> more honourable, who both made them <hi>men,</hi> and made them <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, That by meditating upon their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the beauty which they are now poſſeſt of, we might be perſwaded unto a hate of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and onely let our thoughts bee taken up with <hi>Heaven,</hi> which while they lived <hi>here,</hi> was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4113:39"/> their <hi>ſtudy,</hi> now is their <hi>habitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, That by the celebration of theſe Feaſts, meeting at Gods houſe (as we ought to do) praiſing, and raying unto the Lord, hearing his holy Word read, or preached, we might be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up to further degrees of knowledge and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And were there no other reaſon but this, me thinkes it might move a good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall make a monſter of this Childe of mine, this diſcourſe, in making the head too bigg for the body; ſo that I am afraid you will get to the Text before me, and ſay of my Sermon, as the people did here of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, What manner of Child ſhall this be?</hi> I therefore make haſte to the Text.

            </p>
            <p>If yee move a ſecond queſtion, and <hi>aske where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Iohn was great,</hi> ye ſhall give me leave to ſpring a third, and to aſke <hi>wherein</hi> hee was <hi>not great? Great</hi> he was in his <hi>conception,</hi> great in his <hi>nativity,</hi> great in his <hi>life,</hi> in his <hi>doctrine</hi> great, in his <hi>office</hi> great, great in his <hi>ſanctity,</hi> in his <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> great, great in his <hi>death,</hi> and great in his <hi>glory.</hi> In theſe ſo great, that there was a doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews whether hee was not the Meſſias or no, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. Certainly a great Majeſty, a great beauty, a great holineſſe did appeare in this man, when it was made a queſtion (and that amongſt the greateſt and learnedeſt of the Jews) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4113:40"/> hee were not the Meſſias, and conſequently the Sonne of God or no. But this greatneſſe yet is nothing, alas, it is no ſuch thing to be great in <hi>the eyes of men:</hi> but heare what the Angel tells old <hi>Zachary</hi> in the 15. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus erit coram Domino,</hi> he ſhall be great in the <hi>ſight of God.</hi> This is a kind of greatneſſe which ſhould ſtrike us all with admiration, that hee ſhould bee great in the ſight of <hi>Him,</hi> before whom all the creatures of the world, all Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the earth are nothing? As it is in the Booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> 11.19. <hi>For as the duſt of the ballance, ſo is the world before thee, and as a drop of the morning dew which falleth downe upon the earth:</hi> And as the Prophet <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 40. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him are nothing, and they are counted to him leſſe then nothing and vanitie.</hi> What can bee leſſe then nothing and vanity? and what can bee greater in our ſight, then all Nations? Yet in Gods eſteeme theſe two are laid in the ballance, one againſt the other, and <hi>all Nations</hi> proves the <hi>lighter.</hi> How comes it then to paſſe that <hi>one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> man ſhould bee ſo <hi>great</hi> in his account, when <hi>all Nations</hi> are <hi>nothing?</hi> We muſt know then that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was not great by <hi>nature,</hi> but by <hi>eſtimation.</hi> Not by <hi>nature,</hi> for he was of the ſame compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, caſt in the ſame mold with us: but it pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to ſet a price upon him. He was of the ſame matter and compoſition with us, ſubject to the ſame infirmities, obnoxious (naturally) to the ſame ſinnes, and therefore obſerve that forme of words well, which our Saviour ſpeakes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Verily I ſay unto yee, that amongſt them who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of women, a greater then Iohn the Baptiſt hath not aroſe:</hi> by which word our Saviour doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate unto us the <hi>naturall corrupt eſtate</hi> in which St. <hi>Iohn himſelfe</hi> was borne. <hi>Reſurrectio enim praeſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit caſum.</hi> For, to <hi>ariſe,</hi> doth preſuppoſe a <hi>fall.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid plainer; Amongſt all the ſonnes of men, which were conceived in Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, and <hi>fell</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> a greater then <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> hath not <hi>aroſe from that fall.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is plaine by this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was greater then <hi>hee,</hi> although he came of a woman too. For wee cannot ſay properly, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>ariſe,</hi> becauſe Chriſt never <hi>fell</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> was free both from originall and actuall ſinne. And ſee what haſte this bleſſed more then Prophet did make to <hi>ariſe</hi> from his corrupt eſtate of ſinne? He did <hi>ariſe</hi> even before hee was borne: the Holy Ghoſt did baptize him, did ſanctifie him while he was in the wombe of his mother, as yee reade in the 15 <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, Hee ſhall bee filled with the holy Ghoſt, even from his mothers wombe.</hi> And ſo he was great in his <hi>conception</hi> and <hi>nativity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, he was great in <hi>his life</hi> and <hi>doctrine:</hi> ſo great, that wee finde St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Euangeliſt</hi> in the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> of his Goſpel, having like an <hi>Eagle</hi> (the hieroglyphick of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) for a while ſoared aloft, amongſt the myſteries of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the <hi>divinity,</hi> the <hi>originall,</hi> the <hi>nativity</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and having finiſhed that high flight,

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4113:42"/> the body of his Prince, and was never found farre diſtant from him, to ſhew the greatneſſe and the honour which Chriſt vouchſafed him, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that neerneſſe to his owne Perſon: his voice is neither with the Prophets, <hi>hee will come,</hi> nor with the Apoſtles, <hi>hee is already come;</hi> but (like the Index in the margent of a booke) holding out his finger, hee <hi>points</hi> to him and ſaith; <hi>Ecce agnus Dei qui tollit peccata mundi:</hi> Behold the Lambe of GOD which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But I finde ſome ſmall difference amongſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors concerning this greatneſſe of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> which they will have to be not a greatneſſe or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther majority of <hi>Prophecy</hi> or <hi>revelation,</hi> but of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi> And it is occaſioned by the doubtfulneſſe of the expoſition of thoſe words of our Saviour in the 11. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> named to yee before;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.11.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay unto yee, that amongst them who are begotten of women, aroſe there not a</hi> Greater <hi>then Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The quarrell, although it bee of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is betwixt no meane Authors, no leſſe then St. <hi>Ierome</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> both ancient, learned and religious Fathers: and it is this;</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:4113:43"/> a greater <hi>then Iohn,</hi> will by no meanes have it to follow, that therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>greater</hi> then all the ſonnes of men: but that which naturally followes from hence (ſaith he) is, that none of the ſonnes of men were <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>Iohn.</hi> And ſo by his rule, although none <hi>aroſe greater</hi> then <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet there might be ſome who were his <hi>equalls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 27. <hi>Homily,</hi> in that which is called His imperfect worke upon Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> contends (and mee thinks very ſubtlely and ſtrongly) to prove from hence, that by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſequence St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> muſt needs be greater then all that were begotten of women.

            <p>Here is one thing remains to be explained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his laſt greatneſſe, the greatneſſe of his <hi>glory.</hi> For our <hi>Saviour</hi> addes in that 7. of S. <hi>Luke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 7.28.</note> 
               <hi>Nevertheleſſe, hee who is leaſt in the Kingdome of God, is greater then he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be two anſwers given.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this ſpoken in compariſon of the <hi>Angels,</hi> who were onely yet the inhabitors of the Kingdome of God. For (ſay they) when Chriſt ſpoke theſe words, the Kingdome of Heaven was not open unto the ſoules and ſpirits of <hi>men;</hi> the Key of that was the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, till then there were no men in Heaven. As if our Saviour ſhould have ſaid, nevertheleſſe all this greatneſſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> which I have made mention of, the leaſt in the Kingdome of God (i.) the leaſt amongſt the Angels is greater then hee, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> notwithſtanding all theſe commendations is but a man, but the Angelicall nature is far greater then the nature of man. But this anſwer carries along with it a point in controverſie, not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined amongſt us, as granted, and therefore cannot fully ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The anſwer is. That he who is the leaſt in the Kingdome of God, is <hi>greater then Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> meaning that hee is greater <hi>pro nunc,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:4113:45"/> greater while <hi>Iohn</hi> lived upon the earth. And this greatneſſe ariſes <hi>a ſecuritate &amp; fruitione,</hi> from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and fruition. For hee who rides in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot, muſt needs be ſaid to be greater and happier then he who is yet in the heate of the Battell, although this laſt be farre the worthier and the valianter: becauſe this is yet <hi>in dubio cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamine;</hi> but the other being freed from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his enemies, weares his Garland upon his head in <hi>ſecurity:</hi> and therefore it is not ſaid here, that he who is leaſt in the Kingdome of God, is <hi>holier</hi> or <hi>better</hi> then <hi>Iohn;</hi> but is <hi>greater</hi> then hee, which greatneſſe proceedes from a preſent <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Wee have hitherto Preached unto you of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of this bleſſed <hi>Saint</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> And what harme (I pray yee) is there in all this now? There be a Generation of People (whether it be out of envie, or ignorance, or pride, or from what other root it ſhould proceede I know not) who cannot endure to have any of the <hi>Saints</hi> of of God ſpoken well of; No, the mention of the bleſſed and immaculate Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was the Mother of our Lord and Saviour (a rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, containing in it a farre richer Jewell) whom the Angell of the Lord accoſts with this ſtrange ſalutation; <hi>Haile Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; bleſſed art thou amongst women:</hi> This holy name (I ſay) if it comes in uſherd by the word <hi>Saint,</hi> is diſtaſtfull to many of them, ſuch is their madneſſe, affording a more honourable mention of ſome of their new Saints in a Funerall Sermon,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4113:45"/> then of <hi>her</hi> who was the Mother of <hi>Him,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the World. But theſe people certainly, if they knew my thing, muſt needs know that the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the <hi>followers</hi> doth redound unto the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of their <hi>Lord,</hi> who is able to <hi>make</hi> and to <hi>keepe</hi> ſuch <hi>followers.</hi> And when wee heare of the the greatneſſe of St. <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> me thinks we ſhould all be carried up into a conſideration of <hi>his</hi> greatneſſe who <hi>made</hi> St <hi>Iohn.</hi> For if St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſo great, that by the Teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe, there was not a greater then hee amongſt all who were begotten of Women; O how much greater then muſt he needs be, who was, and is the Lord and Maſter of St. <hi>Iohn!</hi> whoſe <hi>Herald,</hi> whoſe <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,</hi> whoſe <hi>Miniſter</hi> he was, and (as he himſelfe confeſſes) whoſe Shoo-latchet he was not worthy to unlooſe?</p>
            <p>Let ſuch of us therefore who have bin any whit faulty in this kind, learne hereafter to have a more honourable eſteeme of Gods Saints: and of the holy dayes which are dedicated to their memory, and not ſuppoſe (with too many) that they are dayes ſet apart onely for licentiouſneſſe and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe. No, the good intent of the Church was, that there might be preſerved an Anniverſary <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> of their <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> of their lives and deaths, to the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and our owne <hi>inſtruction,</hi> who following their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſhall one day come to be <hi>Saints</hi> our ſelves amongſt them. This was and is the <hi>religious</hi> uſe of holy dayes, not excluding the <hi>Civill,</hi> which is to permit honeſt and lawfull recreations, only with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4113:46"/> this caution: Firſt, ſerve God, and then take thy honeſt and Chriſtian liberty. Let us then make an end of this diſcourſe with praiſe and thanks-giving to Almighty God, for all <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Fathers,</hi> whoſe lives and doctrine God hath ſet up as lights to guide us unto the Kingdome everlaſting: but eſpecially (as this day calls to our memory) for the bleſſed <hi>Saint, Saint Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> who was great in his <hi>concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> great in his <hi>nativity,</hi> great in his <hi>life,</hi> great in his <hi>doctrine,</hi> in his <hi>office</hi> great, great in his <hi>ſanctity,</hi> in his <hi>dignity,</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> great in his <hi>death,</hi> and great in his <hi>glory,</hi> and yet for all theſe greatneſſes, was, and is but the <hi>ſervant</hi> of <hi>thee</hi> who art the <hi>great God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The place of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> which the Euangeliſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> quotes for this Scripture, is the 31. <hi>Chap. verſe</hi> 15. And this Prophecy was fulfilled in the literall ſenſe (as <hi>Cajetane</hi> ſaith) in the Captivity of the children of Iſrael, or of thoſe <hi>tenne</hi> Tribes, which were commonly called <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im.</hi> And the reaſon why the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> brings in <hi>Rachel</hi> here as weeping for her children, is becauſe that <hi>Ephraim</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> whom hee begot of <hi>Potipheras</hi> daughter the prince of <hi>On,</hi> as ye may reade in the 41. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> was lineally deſcended from <hi>Rachel</hi> the mother of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> But this Prophecy in the myſticall ſenſe was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled untill this cruell and bloody Maſſacre of theſe poore Innocent children, by the command of

               <hi>Herod,</hi> and therefore ſaith the Text, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Then was that fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremie.</hi> And the reaſon why <hi>Rachel</hi> is here myſtically called the mother of theſe ſlaine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, is, becauſe ſhee was buried neare unto this City of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> as yee may ſee in the 35. of <hi>Gen.</hi> from whence ſhee was called, <hi>Mater Bethlehemita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the mother of the <hi>Bethlemites.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall not need to trouble either you or my ſelfe much, to lay open to yee ſo knowen a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for to doubt that any (living eſpecially as we doe, in a Church where there is ſuch plenty of knowledge) ſhould be ignorant of this, is as much as to thinke that there may bee a kinde of people who know not whether the Sunne ſhines or not without a teacher. But becauſe it is poſſible that there may be ſuch an ignorance amongſt us, I will in a word or two relate that unto yee, which yee may finde ſet downe a great deale more fully and ſweetly in the Chapter.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour CHRIST, according to the decree of God the Father from all eternity, and according to all the predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in the fulneſſe of time (being by the vulgar Computation in the 3949. yeare of the worlds creation, and withall the 42. of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſars</hi> reigne, and of <hi>Herods</hi> about the 34.) was borne in <hi>Bethleham</hi> a City of Judah, there was a Starre ſent by God to conduct certaine Wiſe men out of the Eaſt Countrey, (which is thought to be <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the reaſon which leades us to thinke this Countrey
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4113:48"/> 
               <hi>Perſia,</hi> is the very name <hi>Magi,</hi> which is a <hi>Perſian</hi> word, and ſignifies as much as amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Wiſemen,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Grecians, Philoſophers,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Indians, Gymnoſophiſts</hi>) who comming to Jeruſalem, and enquiring where hee was, who was borne King of the Jews, <hi>Herod</hi> preſently and all the City with him, were ſtartled at the queſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on: and indeed, according to the policie of this world, and <hi>Herods</hi> principle he built upon, which was, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to bee an <hi>Earthly King,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was time for him to looke about him, and to ſeeke by all meanes to cruſh this <hi>infant King</hi> in his <hi>Cradle:</hi> and therefore immediately upon the arrivall of the <hi>Wiſe men</hi> there, hee calls all <hi>his</hi> Wiſe men together too, all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Scribes</hi> of the people, and demanded of them where it was that Chriſt ſhould be borne; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by them, that <hi>Bethlam</hi> in <hi>Iudea</hi> was the place which all their Prophecies pointed at, he craftily called unto him thoſe <hi>Wiſe men</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and having told them the place, he ſent them away, bidding them to ſearch diligently for the <hi>Babe,</hi> and when they had found him, to bring him word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee might alſo come and worſhip him. Here were words faire enough, but he had a heart in the meane time full of poiſon and blacke inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Magi</hi> having received this command from <hi>Herod,</hi> departed, and by the direction of the Starre, having found Chriſt, they offered to him their Preſents of <hi>gold, frankincenſe,</hi> and <hi>myrrhe;</hi> but being warned by God in a dreame that they ſhould not returne any more to <hi>Herod,</hi> they went
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4113:49"/> into their owne Countrey another way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Herod</hi> finding himſelfe deluded, grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly into a rage, nor could any thing quench his fury but the blood of all the male children in <hi>Bethlam</hi> and the adjoyning Countrey, from two yeares old and downeward. O he had thought he had made ſure worke with <hi>Chriſt</hi> now. Yee have the ſumme of the whole ſtory.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <hi>Rachel</hi> grieves. What was this <hi>Rachel?</hi> A <hi>woman</hi> certainly, for wee heare mention made of <hi>her children</hi> in the following words. A <hi>woman</hi> grieves, and no wonder; for it was <hi>ſhee</hi> who brought <hi>griefe</hi> firſt into the world: for had not <hi>Eue</hi> eaten of the forbidden fruit, there had beene no ſuch things knowne as <hi>griefe</hi> and <hi>ſorrow.</hi> And ſee if this off-ſpring of hers, this monſter of her owne begetting, doth not (like a naturall and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving iſſue) ſticke cloſe to her ſide. This child of the woman, <hi>griefe,</hi> hath never left her, but ſtill gone along with her from its birth: nor is it a thing poſſible to worke a divorce betwixt them, for who can ſeparate thoſe whom God hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>In dolore parturies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> In <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhalt thou bring foorth children: It is the curſe which God laid upon the woman for her offence.</p>
            <p>But it is the woman <hi>Rachel</hi> that grieves. What? that beautifull daughter of <hi>Labans</hi> whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lookes were of more force to binde <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Uncle, then a ſtrickt Indenture, for hee ſerved two Apprentiſhips for her? Is there ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4113:50"/> a <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> in <hi>bleare eyes,</hi> that the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Rachel</hi> by <hi>weeping</hi> ſtrives to looke like her ſiſter <hi>Leah?</hi> Or did ſhee perceive her father <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> intent to give her <hi>ſiſter</hi> firſt craftily into the embraces of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and therefore by <hi>weeping</hi> doth ſhee hope to get the <hi>eyes</hi> of her <hi>ſiſter,</hi> and ſo to <hi>cozen</hi> the <hi>eyes</hi> of her <hi>father,</hi> as her huſband <hi>Iacob</hi> had before gotten the <hi>hands</hi> of his <hi>brother,</hi> and by <hi>them</hi> the <hi>bleſsing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why ſtand I expoſtulating with departed Saints, as if they were living amongſt us? <hi>Rachel</hi> long before the birth of Chriſt, the death of thoſe Innocents, nay long before <hi>Ieremy</hi> wrote this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, dyed, and was buried (as yee may ſee in the 35. of <hi>Gen.</hi>) in the way of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which is <hi>Bethleem.</hi> How then is ſhee ſaid here to weepe? Can the ſoules of Gods deare children, who enjoy a bleſſed quietneſſe, aſſume their bodies againe to undergoe griefe and miſery? It is impoſſible. The <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall bee onely to <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>happineſſe.</hi> No certainely, wee will finde out an interpretation which ſhall bee ſo courteous to ſuffer the body of that good woman to <hi>ſleepe</hi> in quiet. Alas! ſhee had griefe and ſorrow enough while ſhe lived; we may very well ſpare her from any further teares. Shee had her huſband taken from her, and in <hi>her</hi> roome her <hi>ſiſter</hi> given into his boſome, even before her eyes (no ſmall griefe) and when, after a tedious expectation of ſeven yeares more, ſhee had obtained him, her <hi>barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> (having alwayes the fruitfulneſſe of <hi>Leah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face upbraiding of her) was ſuch an allay
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4113:50"/> to her happineſſe, that all her marriage joy was quickly out of minde, ſo that in the bitterneſſe of her ſoule ſhee cries out to her huſband in the 30. of <hi>Gen. ver.</hi> 1. <hi>O give me children, or elſe I die.</hi> It was a ſtrange and unwonted ſtrait that <hi>Rachel</hi> was in, give her <hi>no</hi> children and ſhee <hi>dies;</hi> give her <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and ſhee <hi>dies too,</hi> for they cauſe her death. In giving life to her ſonne <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſhe loſt her <hi>owne;</hi> for ſhee died in Child-birth. Let the griefe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe hath already ſuſtained, ſuffice: Shee muſt not be called up any more from her quiet bed, the grave, to grieve againe.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Rachel</hi> then, who becauſe ſhee was buried in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> was (as I told yee) called the mother of the <hi>Bethlemites,</hi> in a figurative ſpeech is meant the women of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and of the adjoyning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The <hi>women of Bethleem grieve.</hi> Of <hi>Bethleem?</hi> Can there bee any place for griefe to harbour in, in that City wherein CHRIST, <hi>the joy of the whole earth</hi> was borne? Not long ſince wee heard the Angels telling the Shepherds (and wee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it then) that there was tidings of great joy to <hi>all</hi> people. What meanes then this <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in <hi>Ramah?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17. for a little oyle and meale, for a poore entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the widow of <hi>Zareptah</hi> gave him, was ſo courteous and gratefull to her, that hee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced her with the reſtoring of her ſonne to life: And doth Chriſt recompence the place of his <hi>birth,</hi> the place wherein his Eyes (as he was man) firſt ſaluted the light, no better then with a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of griefe? O how truely might the <hi>mothers</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:4113:51"/> of <hi>Bethleem</hi> have taken up that ſpeech of <hi>Zarep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahs</hi> widow to the Prophet; <hi>What have wee to doe with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto us to call our ſinnes to remembrance, and to ſlay our ſonnes?</hi> Did the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhew his thankfulneſſe ſo to the place where hee was for a while nouriſhed, and ſhall <hi>Hee</hi> who is the God of all <hi>compaſsion,</hi> bee more ungratefull, more unkinde, more cruell to the place of his nativity? Fleſh and blood would certainely interpret this to be ingratitude and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. For although he was not the <hi>efficient Cauſe</hi> of this <hi>maſſacre,</hi> yet hee was the <hi>procuring Cauſe,</hi> and withall had <hi>power</hi> if hee had pleaſed to have <hi>prevented</hi> it: and therefore by that <hi>Maxime</hi> of the <hi>Civilians</hi> may in ſome ſort ſtand <hi>guilty</hi> of it. What ſhall wee thinke? Is there cruelty or injuſtice with God? God forbid that we ſhould entertaine ſuch a thought. No, the fault without all queſtion is in our apprehenſion of this thing, wee doe not judge rightly of it. No? doe we not judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? let us therefore joyne all the reſt of the parts behind together, and runne through them. And indeed I durſt keepe them aſunder no longer, for if I ſhould have handled them all in order diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyntedly, I ſhould have beene forced to give yee to a great a potion of <hi>Wormwood</hi> in this time of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Let us ſee then whether wee doe not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it aright or no.</p>
            <p>Wee have a <hi>griefe</hi> here, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this griefe, is <hi>Rachel,</hi> (that is) <hi>the women of Bethleem.</hi> The <hi>vbi,</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of this griefe, <hi>Ramah,</hi> or <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and the <hi>adjacent Countrey,</hi> the <hi>place of Chriſts Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tivity,

It ſeemes to me that we doe. The <hi>lamentation</hi> was <hi>great,</hi> and the <hi>cauſe</hi> was <hi>great</hi> it proceeded from, the ſlaughter of their children, and this was done in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> the <hi>Citie</hi> wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>borne,</hi> and it was done for <hi>his ſake,</hi> for <hi>Chriſts ſake,</hi> who had <hi>power</hi> to have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> all this Doe we not yet apprehend it aright?

            <p n="1">1 The firſt is <hi>Amiſſum bonum, &amp; malum conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</hi> A loſt or abſent good, and a preſent or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired evill. I will not trouble yee with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which of theſe two hath the precedency in cauſing this affection of Griefe, neither need they trouble themſelves to make it a queſtion amongſt them, if <hi>privations</hi> were the ſame in the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſoule,</hi> as they are in the <hi>things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> For a <hi>preſent evill</hi> in it ſelfe being nothing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4113:60"/> elſe but the <hi>abſence</hi> or <hi>privation</hi> of a <hi>good;</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt bee all one to <hi>grieve</hi> for the <hi>evill</hi> that is <hi>preſent</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> that is <hi>abſent.</hi> But being that <hi>griefe</hi> is a <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>appetite</hi> following the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> and that in the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> the <hi>privation</hi> of a <hi>good</hi> hath <hi>rationem cujuſdam entis,</hi> the <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſhape, or outward appearance of a certaine thing <hi>that hath a being,</hi> under that <hi>ſhape,</hi> it may rather bee ſaid to bee the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>griefe,</hi> then the <hi>good</hi> which is <hi>loſt:</hi> becauſe an <hi>evill</hi> that is <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>preſent,</hi> is <hi>nearer</hi> and more <hi>ſenſible,</hi> ſtrikes a deeper <hi>impreſsion</hi> into the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> then the <hi>good</hi> which is <hi>abſent,</hi> although in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they bee all one.

For how can hee who is <hi>Goodneſſe it ſelfe, loſe</hi> that which is <hi>good?</hi> and can any <hi>evill</hi> bee ſaid to happen to <hi>him,</hi> who is the <hi>fountaine</hi> from whence is derived all that is <hi>good.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 The ſecond Cauſe of Griefe (they ſay) is <hi>Concupiſcentia,</hi> concupiſcence, or a deſire of that abſent good which wee are ſenſible of that wee want. And as the firſt Cauſe was <hi>Cauſa ſicut finis,</hi> the object to which griefe doth tend, ſo this is <hi>Cauſa ſicut unde,</hi> A Cauſe as from whence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4113:60"/> of the motion is. As in the naturall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of a ſtone or any other heavy body being to move downwards, the cauſe as the end is the place whither it tends, the center of gravity, having a kinde of Magnetique vertue in it, which drawes it thither: The cauſe as from whence is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination of that body ariſing from the forme of it, which is heavineſſe. So the cauſe of griefe as the end, is the evill which is preſent; but the cauſe as from whence this motion is, is the inward inclination of the appetite which doth encline chiefly, and in the firſt place to that which is good: and ſecondarily and by conſequence to the ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of evill. Now this concupiſcence or deſire longing after good, finding it abſent, and in the roome of it its contrary which hee hates, is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly turned into a griefe: or rather not turned into a griefe, but it ſtill remaines with the griefe, to make the griefe the greater, continually deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which cannot be had.</p>
            <p>But neither is this cauſe able to lay any hold upon Chriſt: for can hee deſire any abſent good, who hath all that is good continually preſent with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Cauſe they will have to be <hi>Appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> unitatis,</hi> A deſire of unity or union. And this is nothing elſe but the ſecond reaſon cloathed in another phraſe: Or if there be any, it is but a little Metaphyſical difference, which doth not conſiſt in the thing it ſelfe, but in the reaſon of maner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the thing. And ſo after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the deſire of good was ſaid there to cauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4113:61"/> griefe, ſo here the deſire or appetite of Unity, which is nothing elſe but good apparelled in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of dreſſe, for the good of every thing (wee know) doth conſiſt in a certaine kinde of Unity. And therefore the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> who were altogether for Harmony, and ſaid, That the whole frame of the world was nothing elſe but a Muſicall Inſtrument, ſet in tune by the hand of that <hi>primum ens,</hi> and <hi>primum principium,</hi> which is God, doe as well make <hi>unum à Principium</hi> as <hi>bonum.</hi> Both which bonity and unity by the way of Participation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though comming infinitely ſhort of that excellence which is in the fountaine of that bonity and unity, is communicated to the creatures, as conducing to their perfection. Now when any thing is cut off from this unity of the creature, or added which is ſuperfluous, (although it be but in his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, and not really) finding his unity infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, (which is the perfection of the crearure) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring this unity which is abſent, and finding a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent impediment, immediatly this deſire begets a griefe.</p>
            <p>But neither can this cauſe come neere or once touch Chriſt, for hee is ſo farre from wanting or deſiring this ſecondary unity, this unity of the creature, that hee is <hi>Vnus cum unitate prima,</hi> One with unity and bonity it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth cauſe which they render is this. <hi>Poteſtas cui non poteſt reſiſti.</hi> A ſtronger power which cannot be reſiſted. For if a preſent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned evill be the proper object of ſorrow, (as is already proved) then that muſt needs be a cauſe of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4113:61"/> that ſorrow which makes or works the preſence or conjunction of this evill, and that is a ſtronger power. For although many times wee ſuffer da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and hurt by a power which ſimply and in it ſelfe is leſſe (as in our ſlumbers wee are often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and moleſted by a Gnat, ſo poore a creature that one fillip of a man is able to deſtroy a million of them) yet in that regard that it hurts, it muſt be called a greater. <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what power in the world can be greater then he, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given? We are not yet got out of the Labyrinth. Let us once more conſult with the Text. And when he was come neere, he beheld the Citie, and wept <hi>for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The knot is untyed, the verſe interprets it ſelfe. He wept <hi>for it.</hi> Not for himſelfe. Hee doth <hi>agere perſonam alterius.</hi> Hee wept <hi>for the Citie. Delirant reges plectuntur Achivi,</hi> was the old ſaying. The Kings commit the offence, and their Subjects ſuffer for it. But here we may juſtly invert that ſpeech, and ſay, <hi>Delirat populus, plectitur eorum Rex.</hi> The people, the Jewes have ſinned, and their King, the King of the Jewes, hee beares the puniſhment of their ſinne. And the Citie of <hi>Ier.</hi> might very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely have uſed thoſe words of <hi>David</hi> (with a little alteration) in the laſt Chapter of the ſecond booke of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Behold I have ſinned, yea I have done wickedly, but this Sheepe what hath he done?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4113:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> What hath he committed, that his eyes ſhould ſend forth ſuch plenty of teares as they doe? — And wept <hi>for it.</hi> The wonder ceaſes. For now wee are able to finde all thoſe foure ſeverall cauſes already mentioned, in this griefe of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For in the firſt place, <hi>Ier.</hi> had loſt, ſhee had quite deprived her ſelfe of all her good by her ſinnes and obſtinacie: and evill was alſo hard at her doore. Deſtruction did hang over her head, like the ſword in the twine threed over the head of the Paraſite in the Throne, wayting but when the breath of the Lord would breake it in ſunder. And therefore he wept.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was <hi>concupiſcentia,</hi> a deſire of that abſent good they were deprived of. Which deſire ſhould have beene in them, but becauſe a kinde of Lethargy and Stupidity had ſeized them: he who bore the infirmities of us all, entertaines it into his owne boſome, into his owne affections. Hee deſired the good of them, which they did not themſelves, and therefore he wept.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he deſired alſo their vnity, their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which doth conſiſt in the concatenation, as it is tyed to, or derived from (as the beames from the Sunne) that <hi>primum unum &amp; bonum,</hi> that firſt One, unity it ſelfe, God. Which chaine of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation being broken, and a ſeparation made by reaſon of their ſinnes, therefore he wept.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee perceived alſo that there was <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas fortior,</hi> a power which was too ſtrong for them, the power of hell, ſin, and darkneſſe, which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4113:62"/> did beare rule over them, and therefore he wept.</p>
            <p>He wept not for the dead Citie, for the walls which were ſhortly to be overthrowne, for her faire Towers and buildings which were ſhortly to be demoliſhed, for her Temple which hee knew was afterwards to be defiled, and caſt downe to the ground, not one ſtone left upon another. Hee did not weepe principally (I ſay) for this. (Although peradventure his griefe might caſt an oblique eye thither too) but the chiefe cauſe of his mourning was the ſinnes and blindneſſe of the people. Which Action as it doth confute the Hereſies of <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Cerdon,</hi> and others, who deny Chriſt to have had a naturall body, and affirme that hee was not borne of a woman, neither had fleſh, nor ſuffered any Paſſion: but had a body meerely phantaſticall, and did faine onely to ſuffer; and beſides, ſhewes unto us his infinite mercy <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which was touched with a fellow-feeling of our infirmities: So eſpecially it teacheth us what the true uſe of teares is. They are not to be laviſhed out upon every ſlight occaſion: but to be reſerved to bee ſpent for ſinne. That is their proper object.</p>
            <p>I doe not goe about to make a mutilation in our affections, or to Preach the Doctrine of the Stoicks to yee, who would have no paſſions at all; There is a ſorrow, there is a debt of <hi>teares</hi> which we owe (and Nature will exact the payment of us) to the Urne of our deceaſed Parents, Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Governours, Kinsfolks, and Friends. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> weepes for his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> ſeaven dayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4113:63"/> The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wept for <hi>Moſes</hi> in the plaine of <hi>Moab</hi> 30. dayes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. But yet with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> wee muſt weepe for our Father <hi>Iacob</hi> but ſeaven dayes, (i.) our mourning muſt be moderate: wee muſt not with the Egyptians bewaile him ſeventy dayes, as men without hope, as they did in the third verſe of that Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> We cannot weepe too much for our ſinnes, for any thing elſe wee may.</p>
            <p>There be other remedies which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our leſſe dangerous maladies, and we are to uſe them. If thou beeſt deprived of thy goods, take <hi>Iobs</hi> confection, and try what good that will doe thee. <hi>The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Naked I came out of my mothers wombe, and naked I ſhall returne againe.</hi> Which very conſideration (we ſee) wrought a cure upon that good man. Doe not weepe for this, it is not worth thy teares. <hi>Vnicus raptus eſt filius?</hi> (as St. <hi>Ierome</hi> to <hi>Paula,</hi> comforting her for the death of her daughter <hi>Breſilla) Durum quidem, ſed tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile, quia ſuſtulit ille qui dederat.</hi> Is thy onely ſonne, or thine only daughter raviſhed from thine eyes by an untimely death? Tis hard, but yet to be endured, when thou conſidereſt that it is that ſame gracious God who lent thee that ſonne or that daughter that hath taken them from thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, neither muſt thou weepe too much for this.</p>
            <p>But I cannot follow any more particulars, and I have dwelt too long in this little Bay into w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. We will now make out into the river again.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And wept for it, ſaying,</hi> (the force of the ſtreame yee ſee carries mee downe into the next <hi>verſe) O, if thou hadſt knowne, even thou, at the leaſt in this thy day.</hi>

Like a great Violl with a narrow mouth, hee is here quite ſtopt up with his owne fulneſſe. Not a drop more yet. Thoſe thoughts of ſorrow which knock at his lips for paſſage, like a crowd at a little doore, while every one ſtrives to be firſt, the paſſage is clogged up, and none of them can get through. But I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſomething elſe comming out, — But now are they hid from thine eyes. <hi>Quid hoc Domine Ieſu? quid hic ſibi vult verborum ſaltus?</hi> What ſhould this meane? what dependance have theſe laſt words upon the former? Art not thou, who art the Word it ſelfe, able to make a congruity in thy words? Thou who waſt able to create ſuch a raviſhing harmony in the world, one thing ſo ſweetly in a comely ſubordination depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, canſt not thou make muſicke of a ſentence? make that agree together? Yes. Here is agreement. Here is Muſick. More, here is Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. More then that, here is the height, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4113:64"/> very iexcellence of all Rhetorick, in this broken ſpeech of our Saviour. For if words bee nothing elſe but our thoughts apparelled in ayery ſyllables, but the expreſſion of our thoughts; then of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoſe muſt needs be the beſt words which come neereſt to the true expreſſion. (as that Picture is the beſt, not that hath the ſmootheſt, or the moſt pleaſingeſt countenance, but which moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the life it repreſents) Now wee would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him but an ill deſcriber of a Paſſion (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of joy, ſorrow, anger, or any other) who makes his ſenſe and words runne in a fine, ſmooth, oylie courſe, without any breaches or abruptions: as if the Soule in that troubled ſea of Paſſion (like the King-fiſher in the Halcion dayes) were at leaſure to build a curious and well-ordered neſt of words. No, Chriſt here doth ſo truely ſet forth to us the Image of a troubled Soule, as they may ſeeme not to bee words which hee ſpeaks; but as if ſorrow ſcorning to uſe the help or mediation of words, ſhould ſpeake it ſelfe in its owne proper language, — O, if thou hadſt knowen, even thou, at the leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! What then? As in that ſpeech of the Father, who being found weeping, and the cauſe of his ſorrow demanded, anſwered, <hi>Filius, unicus, habilis, &amp; pollens ingenio, Adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcens,</hi> — My ſonne, my onely ſonne, a young man, of faire hopes — and being able to goe no farther had his imperfect ſpeech made up by a ſtander by, relieving his halting ſentence (though ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe unto himſelfe) by adding that word, <hi>Obiit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:4113:64"/> is dead, which hee for the greatneſſe of his griefe was not able to pronounce himſelfe: So muſt we make up this imperfect ſpeech of Chriſts, which the thought of the ſinnes and neere-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſion of the City would not ſuffer him to finiſh. <hi>Si cognoviſſes &amp; tu.</hi> If thou hadſt but knowne the danger thou art in, and me thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who am here at hand to deliver thee out of that danger, — What then? Thou wouldeſt have wept, as I doe now; thou wouldeſt have turned all thy jollity into mourning and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee of thy ſinnes in ſackcloth and aſhes, wouldſt have ſought for forgiveneſſe at mee thy Redeemer? But now they are hid from thine eyes. Which latter part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> like the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent carries the ſting in its Taile. For it was the conſideration of that indeed which cauſed all theſe bitter teares; namely becauſe their day was paſt, it was hid from their eyes.</p>
            <p>But I am called backe by the words of an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor. <hi>Domine</hi> (ſaith hee, entring into a Dialogue with Chriſt) <hi>te rogo, cur inquis quod illi te non nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt?</hi> Lord, what doſt thou meane to ſay, they did not know thee? Did not the Multitude carry Palmes in their hands, (as enſignes of thy victory which thou ſhouldſt obtaine over ſinne, death, and hell) meet thee in the way? Did they not ſpread their garments before thee? Did they not call thee with an unanimous conſent, The King of Iſrael? the ſonne of <hi>David?</hi> crying, <hi>Hoſanna, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna, in the Higheſt, bleſſed be the King who commeth in the Name of the Lord.</hi>

            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4113:65"/>
            <p>What anſwer Chriſt himſelfe would have given him, we doe not know; conjecture we may, and firſt thus. As for thoſe people who met him in the way with Palmes in their hands (as upon this day, which from thence, by the inſtitution of the Church, ſtill retaines the name of Palme Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) with Palmes I ſay in their hands, and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of great joy, which there are called a Multitude; Alas! what were they in compariſon of the whole City, but as a drop to the Bucket? beſides that multitude was but of the common ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort of the people; few of the Rulers, or Phariſees were there, and ſuch as were there, were ſo farre from joyning with them in that joyfull confeſſion, that they call to Chriſt to rebuke the multitude, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. Maſter rebuke thy Diſciples. But Chriſt who bore the nature and infirmities of them all, did thirſt after the ſalvation of them all.</p>
            <p>Again, he who is the ſearcher of the reines and heart, did peradventure diſcover that however their outſides did flatter him, uſing a great deale of faire Ceremony and religious Complement, yet for all that many of their hearts were farre enough from him. Hee perceived, for ought wee know, ſome amongſt that multitude (ſuch is the levity and inconſtancy of the people) who, for all their <hi>Hoſannas</hi> now (drawen to it, it may be, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſake, or elſe for the novelty and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing) were afterwards as lowd in the other voice, <hi>Crucifige, crucifige, His blood be upon us and upon our children.</hi> And therefore well might he ſay, they did not know him. They doe not know
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4113:65"/> Chriſt truely, neither will Chriſt know them at the laſt day, who are onely worſhippers of him in outward Ceremony, and not in the Heart.</p>
            <p>The outward Ceremonies of the Church, the carrying of Palmes in our hands, (i.) the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Houſe of the Lord with comely orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is good, <hi>novimus,</hi> wee confeſſe it. The ſpreading of our garments in the way, our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> bowing at the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name of Jeſus, is comely, holy, befitting and reverent. <hi>Quis enim poteſt negare?</hi> but as the Poet to proud <hi>Fabulla,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Sed dum te nimium Fabulla landas,</l>
                  <l>Nec dives, neque bella, neque puella es.</l>
               </q> But ſhould there bee too much ſtirre kept about theſe things as is objected to us, and the ſervice of the inward man in the mean time neglected, they would be in the eſteeme of God neither comely, reverent, nor holy. For hee is more pleaſed with the worſhip of the heart, then with all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pompe of their Feaſts and new Moones.</p>
            <p>But this diſcourſe is not altogether ſo fitting for the times wee live in. Alas! there are not ſuch multitudes of us now, who are found meeting our bleſſed Saviour with Palmes in our hands, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and crying, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> ſpreading our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Aſſe, and in the way: and yet for all this, although the number bee but ſmall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto the multitude of the mockers, but live the gleaning after a Vintage; yet ſee if our new Phariſies be not as buſie now as ever the old ones were about Chriſt, crying, Maſter, rebuke thy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4113:66"/> Diſciples; and ſaying with Judas, (who was a Thiefe and carried the Bag) Wherefore ſerves all this waſt? To what purpoſe are all theſe Palmes and branches of Trees? all this worſhipping, and crying, <hi>Hoſanna in the Higheſt?</hi> Theſe garments ſpread in the way? all this outward Ornament and Ceremony?</p>
            <p>It followes in the <hi>verſe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hadſt thou but knowne, at the leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now are they hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yee obſerve here that Jeruſalem had <hi>her day</hi> of Peace, ſhee had her time of mercy and grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her. And ye may obſerve alſo, that Jeruſalem did neglect this proffered grace, it was hid from her eyes. Who was it that hid it from her eyes? Why certainly our Saviour Chriſt will prove the beſt Interpreter of himſelfe: Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.37.</note> and ſtoneſt them who are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee together as a Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: but yee <hi>would not.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>but yee could not,</hi> but <hi>yee would not.</hi> Surely the fault was their owne. They had <hi>a day,</hi> and the Sunne ſhone clearely over their heads, but they hoodwinkt themſelves, ſhut out the light, and would not ſee.</p>
            <p>But I perceive this ſea of teares is now proved a depth of doctrine (wherein the Leviathan may ſport himſelfe) and all this while wee have but ſtood upon the ſhore and viewed onely the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſurface of this deepe. Nor dare I adventure
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4113:66"/> any farther into it. The Well is deepe (O Lord) and I have nothing wherewith to draw. Let thoſe who have lines and plummets fit for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſuch a worke, ſound and dive to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of this deepe. I will content my ſelfe with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to take a journey to Chriſt upon the face of the Sea onely, to walke with him upon the waves, and if I chance to ſinke, I will pray with him and ſay, Lord ſave me I periſh.</p>

            <p>But I come to this verſe in the Chapter, which I have choſen for my Text: and this they will have to be (as I told yee) the comming of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to their deliverance. <hi>It is the voyce, &amp;c.</hi> Shee falls into an abrupt mention of it, as if from a farre ſhee had heard the voyce of her welbeloved calling to her, and diſtracted (as it were) with joy at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedneſſe of the newes, ſhe breakes forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſuddaine extaſie, It is the voyce of my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved.

Chapter. The latter part of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4113:69"/> the verſe ſets out unto us the <hi>ſpeedineſſe</hi> of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. <hi>Behold hee comes leaping upon the mountaines, and skipping over the hills.</hi> As the Comick Poet ſaith, <hi>Cervum curſa vincit, &amp; gallatorem gradu.</hi> Hee came <hi>leaping</hi> over <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>ſtriding</hi> over <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> as if hee had had <hi>Stiles</hi> on.

            <p>But me thinks this interpretation is too <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>earthy,</hi> and farre below the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>majeſtie</hi> of this ſo <hi>divine a Song.</hi> So that wee may ſay of this Text, as Chriſt did once to the people concerning <hi>Solomon, A greater then Solomon is here:</hi> So may we ſay certainly, a <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>Cyrus</hi> is <hi>here,</hi> is <hi>meant,</hi> here, of whom <hi>Cyrus himſelfe</hi> was but a <hi>Type.</hi> The comming of that <hi>true Cyrus</hi> in this place is meant that <hi>Conquerour,</hi> who made <hi>preparation</hi> for warre, who <hi>came</hi> into the world, aſſumed our <hi>fleſh,</hi> by him <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and made the <hi>weapons</hi> of his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>redeeme</hi> his <hi>choſen Nation,</hi> whom <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> (the devill) had carried into <hi>Captivity</hi> (into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>)</p>
            <p>This Text then may ſet forth unto us either the <hi>comming</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> when in the fulneſſe of time hee was borne of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> ſuffered the <hi>frailties</hi> of <hi>humane Nature,</hi> and at the laſt, death for the ſinnes of the world: Or elſe his <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> to each <hi>particular faithfull ſoule.</hi>

            <p>But before I faſten upon any of theſe, give mee leave to take up an Obſervation or two by the way, which cannot bee very well paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that <hi>hearing</hi> goes <hi>before ſeeing:</hi> The Church <hi>firſt heares</hi> the <hi>voyce</hi> of her <hi>Saviour,</hi> and afterwards ſhee <hi>ſees</hi> him. This is the order which the holy Spirit obſerves in many places of ſacred Scripture. <hi>Heare</hi> O daughter and <hi>ſee,</hi> as yee have it in <hi>Iſay,</hi> and as it is in the laſt of <hi>Iob; I have</hi> heard <hi>of thee by the</hi> hearing <hi>of the</hi> eare; <hi>but now mine eye hath ſeene thee:</hi> And in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when that Comforter which Chriſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, came unto them, yee ſhall reade that <hi>firſt</hi> upon a ſudden there was a <hi>ſound heard</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as of a mighty and ruſhing wind, and after the <hi>Cloven Tongues</hi> like fire <hi>appeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever we hope to bee made partakers of that <hi>beatificall viſion</hi> hereafter in the heavens, which the bleſſed Angels ſo thirſt after, and though they daily enjoy, yet can never bee filled with, One glimpſe of which upon the mountain, was enough to make <hi>Peter</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here, let us build three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, one for Elias,</hi> hee never thought of building of one for <hi>himſelfe:</hi> Hee could have beene content to have lien himſelfe without a ſhelter, ſo bee might ſtill have injoyed this bleſſed <hi>ſight.</hi> If ever (I ſay) wee looke to <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>face</hi> of God hereafter with <hi>joy,</hi> wee muſt <hi>firſt heare</hi> his <hi>voyce;</hi> heare him in his <hi>Prophets,</hi> heare him in his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> heare him in his <hi>Prieſts,</hi> in the diſpenſers
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4113:70"/> of his Word and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that the Church no ſooner <hi>heares</hi> but preſently ſhee <hi>knowes</hi> him by his <hi>voyce. It is the voyce of my Welbeloved</hi> (ſaith ſhe.) Shee laies it downe peremptorily. <hi>My ſheepe know my voyce,</hi> ſaith our Saviour.</p>

Victus es O Archangele, tranſiliit te, qui praemiſit te</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Bernard) quem modo in coelo reliquiſti, in utero reperis.</hi> O Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> thou art overcome, he who <hi>ſent</hi> thee, is <hi>arrived before</hi> thee, <hi>him</hi> whom but now thou <hi>lefteſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> thou <hi>findeſt</hi> in the <hi>wombe.</hi> Obſerve therefore what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith himſelfe in the third of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel, verſe 13. when hee <hi>was</hi> upon <hi>earth,</hi> diſcourſing with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. For no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>aſcendeth up to heaven, but hee who deſcended from heaven, the Sonne of Man, which is in heaven.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, which <hi>was</hi> in heaven, but which <hi>is</hi> in heaven. A miracle! <hi>In terra loquebatur, &amp; in coelo ſe eſſe dicebat.</hi> That very inſtant wherein <hi>Chriſt ſpake</hi> thoſe words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>earth,</hi> hee was <hi>preſent</hi> in <hi>heaven. Semper enim ibi erat Chriſtus, quo fuerat rediturus.</hi> For Chriſt <hi>was</hi> ever <hi>there,</hi> never departed from that place, to which he was to returne. Wherefore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:4113:71"/> gloſſes upon this place thus; <hi>Sic venit ut inde non abſcederet; ſic redit ut nos non derelinqueret.</hi> Hee ſo <hi>comes</hi> from <hi>heaven,</hi> that ſtill he <hi>remaines there:</hi> hee ſo <hi>returnes thither</hi> againe, that <hi>ſtill</hi> wee have his <hi>preſence here. Quid miramini? Deus hoc facit.</hi> Why doe ye wonder? it is <hi>God</hi> who doth all this, whoſe glorious preſence fills the whole world.</p>
            <p>And this may give ſome ſatisfaction to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which may be made; How can God bee ſaid to <hi>move?</hi> to <hi>come</hi> or to <hi>goe?</hi> to <hi>aſcend</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend?</hi> when there is neither <hi>ubi</hi> nor <hi>quando in Deo,</hi> neither relation of <hi>place,</hi> nor <hi>time</hi> in God?</p>
            <p>It is anſwered, That it is true that God <hi>is</hi> every where. <hi>If I aſcend into heaven thou art there: If I lie downe in hell thou art there alſo, let mee take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt part of the Sea, yet thither ſhall thy hand leade mee, and thy right hand hold mee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> But yet the <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation</hi> of his preſence is not every where. God is ſaid to <hi>come</hi> to a <hi>place,</hi> when he is pleaſed there to <hi>manifeſt</hi> his preſence. So CHRIST is ſaid to <hi>deſcend,</hi> to <hi>come</hi> into the <hi>world,</hi> into this <hi>lower</hi> world, when hee out of the riches of his mercy, did vouchſafe to <hi>appeare</hi> in the fleſh</p>
            <p>And for the other branch of the objection, that God cannot be ſaid to <hi>move,</hi> becauſe his actions are not limitted or meaſured by <hi>time:</hi> it is true againe, For St. <hi>Auguſtine, In aeternitate ſempiternus eſt dies, qui nec praeceditur heſterno, nec excluditur craſtino.</hi> In eternity <hi>Time</hi> hath no place: for there is a day which hath neither a <hi>yeſterday</hi> to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, nor a to <hi>morrow</hi> to thruſt him out of his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4113:71"/> place. But yet in <hi>regard of us,</hi> God may bee ſaid to doe many things in <hi>time</hi> I, that very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act of Gods in aſſuming our humane Nature, is ſaid to be done in the <hi>fulneſſe of time, Gal</hi> 4.4. When the <hi>fulneſſe of time</hi> was come, God ſent his Sonne made of a woman.</p>
            <p>Now wee have ſeene how God may be ſaid to <hi>move</hi> or to <hi>come,</hi> let us look upon the <hi>manner</hi> of his comming, &amp; the <hi>way</hi> both together. <hi>Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountaines, and skipping over the hills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee leaps <hi>upon,</hi> he <hi>skips over.</hi> The Spirit of God like the winde, moveth which way it liſteth. I <hi>will</hi> have <hi>mercy</hi> on <hi>whom</hi> I <hi>will</hi> have <hi>mercy.</hi>

            <p>But this place of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> may be anſwered with the ſame words that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers that argument of <hi>Calvins,</hi> drawen from that place in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to prove that Chriſt did undergoe the <hi>paines</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> verſe 24. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, and</hi> looſed <hi>the ſorrowes of Hell:</hi> Now ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> No man can be ſaid to be <hi>looſed</hi> from that to which he was never <hi>bound.</hi>

So will wee be bold to borrow that ſentence of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to anſwer (or rather to interpret) his owne words. <hi>Chriſtus momordit infernum, hoc eſt, partem hominum a poteſtate abſtulit inferni, non quos infernum tenebat, ſed ne teneret omnino.</hi> Chriſt did bite Hell, (that is) tooke a part from thence, not that ever that part (meant of the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> and holy men dying under the Law) was <hi>holden there in chaines;</hi> but becauſe Chriſt did <hi>bite</hi> or deſtroy that power, which (had it not beene taken away) would have kept them there captives for ever. Thus dare not we upon meere preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our owne, goe ſo farre as the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> with more Chriſtian modeſty we may reſt in this.

            <p>But the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Daunce</hi> beginnes to <hi>alter.</hi> Chriſt is no longer the onely <hi>Masker</hi> now: The <hi>mountaines</hi> and the <hi>hills</hi> which he leaps upon, begin to joyne with him, and doe <hi>leape themſelves. What ayle yee O yee mountaines that yee skip like rammes?
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4113:86"/> and yee little hills like young ſheepe?</hi> What ayles them? If ye will be pleaſed but to accompany me to the Sepulchre, there wee may peradventure learne the cauſe of this ſo great and ſudden joy, diſcover what powerfull kinde of Muſicke this is, which addes <hi>wings</hi> to the <hi>heeles</hi> of <hi>Mountaines,</hi> and againſt all <hi>Philoſophy</hi> makes <hi>heavy</hi> things move <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Certainely what ever it bee, it cannot bee leſſe then the ſtraine of an <hi>Angel,</hi> which carries ſuch a vertue along with it. And it is the <hi>muſicke</hi> of an Angel indeed. <hi>Reſurrexit, non eſt hic.</hi> Hee is <hi>riſen</hi> hee is not <hi>here:</hi> why <hi>ſeeke</hi> yee the <hi>living</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>dead?</hi> O pleaſant and moſt raviſhing Song!

Let the memory of <hi>Orpheus</hi> die for ever, and let not <hi>Arion</hi> bee hereafter mentioned; for alas, all that they could doe (and invention was forced to play the wanton in expreſſions, and faine them miracles too) was but onely to make a poore <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſo kinde to carry him to ſhore, a creature which naturally is in love with Muſicke, or elſe to gather a few ſcattered ſtones together to build the walls of a City: But behold, here a note which makes the ponderous Mountains trace it in a ring.

            <p>At his death, the <hi>inanimate world</hi> had but two things in it that were precious, the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and wee finde them both <hi>mourners</hi> at his <hi>Funerall.</hi> That great light of heaven ſeeing him die upon the Croſſe, full of griefe and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mufled himſelfe up in a duſky garment of cloudes, nor did he judge the ſonnes of men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any <hi>light</hi> from <hi>him</hi> who had put out the <hi>light of the world.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> which was the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>whole earth,</hi> rather then it will want a <hi>mouth</hi> to <hi>utter</hi> the <hi>ſorrow it conceived</hi> at that ſpectacle <hi>rends</hi> in ſunder to give it <hi>vent.</hi> But the dayes of <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring blacke</hi> are now paſt, the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>mourning</hi> is gone, elſe how comes it to paſſe that Mount <hi>Sion</hi> leapes like a young <hi>Hart,</hi> and <hi>Syrion</hi> like an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne? Hee is riſen</hi> ſaith the Angel. But <hi>who</hi> is this that is <hi>riſen,</hi> that the <hi>mountaines</hi> are ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> at the <hi>buſineſſe?</hi> Why, it is the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>maker</hi> both of the <hi>mountaines</hi> and <hi>valleys,</hi> that ſame great Lord who tells us that all the beaſts of the forreſt are his, and the cattell upon ten thouſand Hills: Hee who in the purſuit after us <hi>leapt</hi> out of <hi>heaven</hi> into a <hi>ſtable,</hi> indured the <hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> hee who ſuffered the <hi>reproaches</hi> of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was <hi>ſcourged, reviled, ſpit upon, crowned with thornes;</hi> he whom but now we left in the <hi>grave,</hi> guarded with <hi>Souldiers,</hi> as if the fetters of death were not ſtrong enough for him, <hi>Hee</hi> is now <hi>riſen.</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:4113:87"/> The joyfulleſt newes that ever was heard upon earth. <hi>(This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and be glad in it.)</hi> For if hee had riſen no more, but that Death had had the victory over him, his <hi>miraculous conception,</hi> his <hi>ſtupendious birth,</hi> his cruell <hi>ſufferings,</hi> his ignominious <hi>death,</hi> and all that hee hath endured for us, had not a whit availed us. But now wee ſee to our infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the houſe of death was too weak a Priſon for him, and the gates of Hell were not able to prevaile againſt him. Let not us therefore who have a greater intereſt in this bleſſed newes then all creatures whatſoever, bee more ſtupid then the <hi>heavy mountaines</hi> which in an extaſie of joy, are found <hi>leaping</hi> and <hi>skipping, Pſalm.</hi> 114. Not that the mountaines did <hi>really</hi> leape, but by a kinde of <hi>Proſopopaea,</hi> to intimate unto us that infinite joy, thoſe glad tidings which now were come unto men, even the weighty mountaines themſelves (which are the unlikelieſt part of the world for any ſuch motion) are brought in by the holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to trace it in a daunce. Which figure doth firſt accuſe us men, both of <hi>ingratitude</hi> and <hi>ſtupiditie.</hi> Secondly, it doth incite us to ſhake off that drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. It doth <hi>accuſe</hi> us firſt; For how can <hi>wee</hi> at all bee accounted <hi>worthy</hi> of that <hi>great benefit,</hi> who ſuffer our ſelves to bee <hi>overcome</hi> even of <hi>ſenſleſse</hi> creatures in expreſſions of <hi>joy.</hi> Or goe farther, and ſuppoſe that theſe mountaines were ſenſible, that they were able to move out of their places, yet what doth the riſing of Chriſt concerne them? Had hee never died at all, or being dead, had hee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4113:88"/> never riſen, wee may conjecture that their eſtate had beene all one; the <hi>Sunne had</hi> ſent as <hi>gentle rayes</hi> upon them as hee doth <hi>now,</hi> they had had their viciſſitudes of ſeaſons and times as well as now; the <hi>Starres</hi> had looked upon them with the <hi>ſame Aſpects,</hi> and the <hi>ayre</hi> which circumſcribes them, had beene as courteous to them as now. The <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, hath not purchaſed any <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe</hi> or immortality for <hi>them.</hi> For they ſhall <hi>ſmoake when the Lord toucheth them,</hi> and <hi>melt like waxe at the preſence of God,</hi> when he comes to judge the whole earth. But let us looke into <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and wee ſhall finde multitudes of arguments indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us, nay enforcing <hi>us</hi> to a thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his mercies. Hee was <hi>borne, not</hi> for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but for <hi>us:</hi> hee endured miſery <hi>not</hi> for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but for <hi>us:</hi> hee <hi>dyed</hi> for <hi>us, not</hi> for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> for <hi>us</hi> he was <hi>buried,</hi> for <hi>our ſakes</hi> hee went <hi>downe</hi> into <hi>hell,</hi> and came from thence in triumph, and he <hi>roſe</hi> againe for <hi>our</hi> juſtification. Wee were before children of <hi>darkneſſe</hi> and of the <hi>night:</hi> but now by his <hi>reſurrection</hi> wee are made heires of the light and day. Before we were the <hi>curſed</hi> children of <hi>Adam,</hi> under the dominion of death and hell: but now by his reſurrection wee are adopted the bleſſed ſonnes of God, and made inheritours of life everlaſting. And are theſe ſmall favours (think yee) that we take no more notice of them, but ſit ſtill (like <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard) with our hands in our boſomes, and ſuffer the very hills to take our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from us? Let us at leaſt joyne our ſelves with them in this rejoycing, for feare leaſt hereafter for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4113:88"/> this neglect wee be glad to wooe thoſe <hi>mountaines</hi> to <hi>fall</hi> on us, (and be denied,) and to cry unto the hills, Cover us from the preſence of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and juſt God, whoſe loving kindneſſe we have contemned. We have <hi>our Graves</hi> too, even while wee live here on earth, to ariſe out of, the <hi>graves</hi> of our <hi>ſinnes.</hi> There is a two-fold <hi>reſurrection,</hi> as well a reſurrection from <hi>ſinne,</hi> as from <hi>death:</hi> and let that man never hope to bee a partaker in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, (which is from <hi>death</hi>) unleſſe hee have his part in the firſt, in the riſing from <hi>ſinne.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen from the <hi>graves</hi> of our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> let us <hi>leape</hi> upon the <hi>mountaines,</hi> grow on from <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>ſtrength,</hi> from <hi>Altitude</hi> to <hi>Altitude,</hi> from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection to another, untill at laſt wee come to leape upon thoſe <hi>mountaines</hi> amongſt which <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which is <hi>above</hi> is ſcituated.</p>
            <p>Wee are now come to take our laſt farewell of Chriſts <hi>corporall preſence,</hi> till wee ſhall enjoy it for ever.

            <p>Miſtake me not, I know it is not for <hi>all</hi> men to live ſequeſtred from the world; for as God hath made <hi>ſome</hi> for a <hi>contemplative</hi> life (who indeed of all men are the moſt happy, being voyde of <hi>cares,</hi> of <hi>ſtrifes,</hi> of <hi>envyings,</hi> of <hi>backbitings,</hi> (things which ſuch men as are any whit verſed in the buſineſſe of the world, doe finde too frequent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) and hath no imployment, but onely to pray and ſend up praiſes unto his gracious Creator, and Redeemer) ſo hee hath framed <hi>ſome</hi> men alſo for <hi>Action:</hi> and it would be a very <hi>cruell</hi> and <hi>unjuſt ſentence,</hi> if wee ſhould <hi>exclude</hi> all <hi>ſuch</hi> from any <hi>Commerce</hi> with the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and ſo ſhut off the

But how? Why, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was not altogether ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with his warlike imployments, but had his times of retiring, and <hi>retreating</hi> to privacy and devotion: For wee reade in the 10. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that hee prayed continually; (that is, often) and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> he had his ſallies out too from his cares and worldly troubles. He did <hi>per poſticum fallere clientem,</hi> he made his journeys <hi>privately</hi> to Chriſt by <hi>night.</hi> And herein is the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of a mans <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of his <hi>heart</hi> and devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, ſhewen, in that he is able in the midſt of a <hi>crowde</hi> of Clients, and ſecular <hi>imployments,</hi> to <hi>ſet</hi> ſome houres <hi>apart</hi> for the ſervice of his GOD. To live a <hi>retired</hi> life, and to turne ones backe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, is (I confeſſe) of the two the <hi>ſafer</hi> way, but yet <hi>ſavours</hi> the more of the <hi>Coward:</hi> and to runne the courſe of the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>imployed</hi> man, though it be <hi>more dangerous,</hi> yet withall it is <hi>more honourable,</hi> if he bee able to <hi>overcome</hi> all thoſe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> and in ſpite of <hi>buſineſſe</hi> to bee <hi>religious.</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:4113:94"/> And they who can doe thus, may very well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongſt the number of the <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mountaines,</hi> on which the holy Spirit comes <hi>leaping.</hi> For although ſometimes they may bee called <hi>Plateae potius quam montes, Streets</hi> or <hi>high wayes</hi> rather then <hi>untroden mountaines,</hi> by reaſon of their <hi>imployments;</hi> yet ſo long as their ſecular cares do not make too deepe impreſſions in them, when they betake themſelves againe to the meditation of heavenly things, all the other vaniſh away as if there had never beene any ſuch footſteps to bee ſeene: but rather on the contrary the <hi>footſteps</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> appeare in all their actions. For what place ſoever the holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to leape upon, be ſure that thou ſhalt finde the <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of God</hi> left behinde there, ſo that hee who runnes may reade them, and bee bold to affirme, and ſay, The Lord hath travelled over this ground.

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:4113:96"/> here.

               <p>
                  <hi>O God, I thanke thee that I am not as other men, Extortioners, vnjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane. I faſt twice in the Weeke, I give Tithes of all that ever I poſſeſſe.</hi>

               <p>'Tis well the Holy Scripture tells us that this is a Prayer, certainely we ſhould hardly have believ'd it elſe. It has a ſtrange beginning, nay the whole ayre of it is ſomething harſh to be called a Prayer. <hi>Iuſtus in principio accuſator eſt ſui.</hi> The juſt and godly man, he commonly begins his Prayer with an accuſation of himſelfe: ſo ABRAHAM in the 18. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 27. praying for the <hi>Sodomites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ge. 18.27</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, now I have begun to ſpeake unto my Lord who am but duſt and Aſhes.</hi> As if <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſayd, let not my Lord be angry although I <hi>who am a Sinner my ſelfe,</hi> doe entreat for other Sinners. So IACOB <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>O God</hi> of my Father ABRAHAM, <hi>I am leſſe then all thy Mercies.</hi> So DAVID in the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>Who am I O Lord God, and what is my Houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> So DANIEL <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſneſſe belongeth unto thee: but unto us confuſion of Face.</hi> And thus doe all Godly men begin their Supplications: but the Phariſee he expreſſeth in other kinde of language, <hi>God I thanke thee, I am not as other men, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may appeare at the firſt, that the Phariſee did well in doing thus. For St. PAVL tells us in his 5. to the <hi>Epheſ. That we ought to give thankes alwayes for all things unto God the Father.</hi> And DAVID and EZEKIAS, and S. PAUL himſelfe, and ZACCH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>EUS, do all of them <hi>ſpeake</hi> of their <hi>good works.</hi> Why then is the Phariſee condemn'd for this? I anſwer, that it is one thing to praiſe God for the good things that are in us, as acknowledging him to be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thour</hi> from whence we have all thoſe good things. Another thing onely to name God <hi>formally</hi> and

               <p>The 2. ſtep of his Humility, was his <hi>defected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> Hee would <hi>not lift ſo much as his Eyes to Heaven.</hi> Even for very ſhame, hee was afrayd to <hi>looke</hi> up towards <hi>that part</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> wherein Gods glory does moſt appeare. This is the true humility of the heart indeed, this is the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when a man out of the conſideration of his <hi>Sinnes,</hi> does riſe into a conſideration of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Majeſty, againſt whom thoſe <hi>Sinnes</hi> were committed, and ſo trembles and quakes at the thought of it. Thus did <hi>Eſdras</hi> when hee prayed for the people. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I am confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and aſhamed to lift up my face unto thee, becauſe our iniquities are multiplyed over our head, and our ſinnes are gone up before thee into Heaven.</hi> Thus did MARY MAGDALENE in the 7. of St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Shee accounted her ſelfe unworthy to appeare <hi>before</hi> CHRIST, to looke up to the <hi>Heaven</hi> of his <hi>Face:</hi> and therefore, ſhe got <hi>behinde his backe,</hi> kneeled downe at his feet, waſh'd them with her teares, and dryed them with the hayres of her head. Nor would ſhe ariſe from thence, as if her eyes had beene in love with the Earth, till ſhee heard that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4113:122"/> comfortable word, till the heavie burthen of her ſinnes which preſs'd her down, was remov'd from her ſhoulders by the voyce of CHRIST, ſaying; <hi>Thy ſinnes be forgiven thee:</hi> and then ſhee roſe up and went away in peace of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>His third ſtep was, <hi>He ſmote his breſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was <hi>angry</hi> with the <hi>Inhabitant,</hi> and becauſe he could not come at <hi>him,</hi> he takes his <hi>revenge</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the houſe</hi> he lives in; he <hi>knocks</hi> at his <hi>doore: Cor credo evocaturus foràs,</hi> and that with a great deale of indignation.

               </p>
               <p>As our Saviour ſayes in the 15. of St. <hi>Mathew.

            <p>It has beene, and ſtill is, the cuſtome of ſome Princes and great Potentates, that they might keep themſelves in repute and eſtimation with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to reſerve themſelves cloſe, and not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare too commonly unto the vulgar; becauſe, the frequent ſight of the Prince does diminiſh and make cheape the glory of Majeſtie: As we ſee it is verified in the Sun, that excellent and beautifull creature of the Lords, which becauſe we have it in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4113:130"/> our eyes every day, is not much regarded: it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it climbes to its Altitude, and when it is there, it deſcends againe, it ſets, and all this while no great notice taken of it; becauſe this journey of his is <hi>quotidian,</hi> is ordinary; whereas, if it ſhould appeare unto us but once in an Age, what gazing and wondring there would be at it? Not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage this cuſtome, I muſt rather commend the worldly policie of that way which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, tooke to maintaine and increaſe his eſteeme and adoration amongſt his Subjects, who refuſing to be called the Sonne of <hi>Philip,</hi> gave out, that he was begot of <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi> deſcended lineally of a <hi>God,</hi> and ſo he was believ'd to be.</p>
            <p>Both theſe wayes if yee ſearch into them, will meete in one, and make a faire Path for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to walke in. For firſt, to maintaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his renowne, let him reſerve himſelfe (in the name of God) from the People, let him keepe himſelfe cloſe, appeare not to them too common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nay let him not appeare unto them at all. (1) Let him be remov'd, keepe his convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them in his manners, in his actions, be not polluted with their ſinnes. As a Ruler is a God in <hi>Authority,</hi> ſo he ſhould be a God in <hi>Purity</hi> of life and <hi>Example.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond Part of the Text.</p>
            <p>The reaſon, why MOSES put this covering upon his face while he talked with the people, without all doubt, according to the letter, was that, which is rendred by the holy Ghoſt in this Chapter: <hi>The people were afraid to come neere him.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But wee are not alwayes ſtrictly to keepe our ſelves to the literall meaning of Scripture: For St. BERNARD having rendred two or three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſes upon one place, ſayes thus: <hi>Non ſanè à prudente de diverſitate ſenſuum indicabar, dummo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For why ſhould that diſpleaſe us in the ſenſe of the Scriptures, which we daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and allow of in the uſe of outward things.

            <p>The <hi>myſticall</hi> reaſons then of this <hi>Velamen,</hi> this covering of MOSES, may be divers, according to the diverſity of the Lawes given by him:</p>
            <p>Which, were eyther —
<list>
                  <item>Morall,</item>
                  <item>Ceremoniall,</item>
                  <item>Iudiciall.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By the Covering that was upon the face of the <hi>Morall</hi> law, ſome of the ancient Fathers would underſtand the <hi>humanity of</hi> CHRIST, whereby the terror of that glittering Countenance was taken away, ſo that the Sonnes of men by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that veyle, were now become able to looke
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4113:132"/> upon that Face, which otherwiſe had beene too full of horrour for them: the putting on of that Covering was the fulfilling of the Law, and the perfect obedience of CHRIST to every <hi>Iota</hi> in it: For although he was not exhibited untill the latter times, yet the vertue of his obedience (being in efficacy before his exhibition) did put a <hi>Covering</hi> upon the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Veyle</hi> upon his Face, as the giver of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> was the <hi>Cermonies</hi> themſelvs, the ſhining Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was that which was meant by thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, being ſhadowes of things to Come, as the Apoſtle calls them.</p>
            <p>And why may not we underſtand by this Veyle upon the Face of MOSES as the giver of the <hi>Law Iudiciall,</hi> that covering of <hi>Aequitie</hi> which ſhould be upon the Civill Magiſtrate? and this <hi>Aequitas,</hi> (for ſo the <hi>Latines</hi> render that word which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

A young man <hi>compeld by hunger,</hi> ſteales from his neighbour, bread or other neceſſaries whereby to releeve and ſuſtaine <hi>Nature.</hi> The ſtrictnes of our law ſayes (now as I ſuppoſe) that this man muſt <hi>dye.</hi> But the Iudge weighing the circumſtances of the fact; as firſt, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour is a <hi>young man</hi> raſh, and unexperienced in the world, a <hi>young man,</hi> not <hi>gray hayr'd</hi> in iniquity, nor ſinning upon <hi>inveterate cuſtome,</hi> peradventure it is the <hi>firſt offence,</hi> and therefore there may be hope of his amendment. Secondly, he did not ſinne <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſlie,</hi>

Wherefore the Greekes confound thoſe two words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, his admirable mercy, whereas hee might have juſtly ſlaine them preſently, he ſuffers them to live that they might have a ſpace for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The like are frequent in the Scriptures: nay, the whole world is nothing elſe but a great Booke, full of the like examples. For alas! ſhould the Lord have executed the ſtrict rigour of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> upon every one of us, we had beene carryed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the wombe of our Mother unto the Grave.

            <p>Equitie does not any way change, oppoſe, or alter that <hi>Ius naturale,</hi> that naturall juſtice, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4113:134"/> degrees, it mittigates the ſtrictneſſe of the Law, where the Law-giver has not left any thing expreſt.</p>

            <p>An other way of accuſing falſely, is, when thou tel'ſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> (though it bee nothing but the <hi>Truth</hi>) with a wicked intent, ayming to doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.

            <p>But theſe things yee know better farre (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) then I am able to direct yee: yet it is not a <hi>bare</hi> knowledge of them that will benefit yee in the laſt day: but <hi>Happy are yee if yee doe them.</hi> It it not the knowledge that ſwims above in the braine, but that which ſinkes downe into the heart, takes root in the affections, and brings forth fruit in actions, that will then profit thee: For to whom much is given, of him much ſhalbe required; not onely the <hi>Principall</hi> which was truſted to the <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and <hi>Theorye,</hi> but alſo the <hi>intereſt</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the <hi>Practick part.</hi>

            <p>Doe therefore all things as beeing aſſured, that you your ſelves one day ſhall be ungodded againe, (for he who has ſayd yee are <hi>Gods,</hi> has alſo ſayd that yee ſhall <hi>dye like men.</hi>) For the time ſhall come when a poore <hi>Vrne</hi> ſhall hold your <hi>Aſhes,</hi> all, that little all which ſhall remaine of your voluminous greatneſſe, when that <hi>Eternall Iuſtice,</hi> ſhall poize the ballance with an equall hand, wicked AHAB ſhall then anſwer for NABOTHS Vineyard, and IEZEBELL for the bloud of the Prophets. Have but this therefore in your mindes, and the God of all Iuſtice and mercy direct your actions: labour to goe up into the <hi>Mountaine</hi> with MOSES, and conſult with the Lord, (1) Be juſt and righteous, let your faces reflect thoſe <hi>cornua lucis,</hi> thoſe beams of light yee ſhall there receive from God, and with MOSES your faces ſhall ſhine amongſt the people, yee ſhall be honour'd and reverenc'd, <hi>(ride on then, and good lucke have yee with your honour)</hi> and having paſt a glorious life here below, the end of the Text ſhall be the end of your dayes; <hi>Yee ſhall goe up againe and ſpeake with God:</hi> where your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhall never be interrupted ſo long as there is Eternity. For if with MOSES yee <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and converſe with GOD, that is, be imploy'd in his ſervice, and doe Iuſtice, yee ſhall alſo with MOSES, at the length, heare that invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of GOD to him in the 32. of <hi>Deutr.</hi> 50. <hi>verſe.
